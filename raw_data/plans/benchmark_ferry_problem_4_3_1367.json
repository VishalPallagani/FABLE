    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (debark), is the predicate '('at-ferry', 'l3')' potentially from the effect of Step 2 (sail) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('at-ferry', 'l3')' which is added by Step 2."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' from Step 2 (sail) still available for Step 3 (debark)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' added by Step 2 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (board), is the effect '('on', 'c1')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 3)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('on', 'c1')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 3, but it is deleted first by Step 3."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 3 (debark) were skipped, would Step 4 (board) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 3 removes effect '('empty-ferry',)', which is a precondition for Step 4."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 4 (board) and Step 6 (debark) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 7 (sail(l0, l1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')' is used by the next step, Step 8 (board(c0, l1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 7 produces effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 8."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 9 (sail(l1, l3)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 7 and Step 10",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 7 (which provides precondition '('at-ferry', 'l1')'). It must occur before Step 10 (which consumes effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
