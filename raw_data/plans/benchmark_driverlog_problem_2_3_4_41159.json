    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 4 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' potentially from the effect of Step 3 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 4 uses predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' which is added by Step 3."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' from Step 3 (walk) still available for Step 4 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' added by Step 3 appears available for Step 4 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (load-truck), is the effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck3')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 12)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck3')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 12, but it is deleted first by Step 12."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 10 (drive-truck) were skipped, would Step 11 (drive-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 10 removes effect '('at', 'truck3', 's4')', which is a precondition for Step 11."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 5 (drive-truck) and Step 12 (unload-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 8 (drive-truck(truck3, s4, s1, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck3', 's1')' is used by the next step, Step 9 (unload-truck(package2, truck3, s1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 8 produces effect '('at', 'truck3', 's1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 9."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 6 (load-truck(package2, truck3, s4)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 5 and Step 9",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 5 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck3', 's4')'). It must occur before Step 9 (which consumes effect '('in', 'package2', 'truck3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
