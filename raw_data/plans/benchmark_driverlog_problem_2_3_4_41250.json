    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 2 (drive-truck), is the predicate '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board-truck) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 uses predicate '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' from Step 1 (board-truck) still available for Step 2 (drive-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 2 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (board-truck), is the effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 2)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck2')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 2 and not deleted before then."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 2 (drive-truck) were skipped, would Step 3 (load-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 2 removes effect '('at', 'truck2', 's1')', which is a precondition for Step 3."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 3 (load-truck) and Step 4 (load-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 2 (drive-truck(truck2, s3, s1, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck2', 's1')' is used by the next step, Step 3 (load-truck(package4, truck2, s1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 produces effect '('at', 'truck2', 's1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 3."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 5 (drive-truck(truck2, s1, s3, driver1)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 2 and Step 6",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 2 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck2', 's1')'). It must occur before Step 6 (which consumes effect '('at', 'truck2', 's3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
