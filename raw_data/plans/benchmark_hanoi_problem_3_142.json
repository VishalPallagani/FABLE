      "question": "Default: Is any predicate used in a step's precondition fulfilled by a previous step's effect?",

      "explanation": "No clear instance found where a step's precondition is directly added by a previous step with these rules."

      "question": "Default: Is a predicate added early still available when needed later?",
      "answer": "N/A",

    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 1 (move) were skipped, would Step 2 (move) become invalid?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on direct effects, skipping Step 1 doesn't seem to remove any preconditions added solely by it for Step 2."

      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 2 (move) and Step 1 (move) run concurrently?",

    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 2 (move(d1, d3, d2)) must occur?",
