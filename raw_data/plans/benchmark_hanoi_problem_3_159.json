      "question": "In Step 2 (move), is the predicate '('clear', 'peg3')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (move) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 uses predicate '('clear', 'peg3')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('clear', 'peg3')' from Step 1 (move) still available for Step 2 (move)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('clear', 'peg3')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 2 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (move), is the effect '('clear', 'peg3')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 2)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('clear', 'peg3')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 2, but it is deleted first by Step 2."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 2 (move) were skipped, would Step 3 (move) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 2 removes effect '('clear', 'd2')', which is a precondition for Step 3."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 3 (move) and Step 1 (move) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Step 3 deletes a precondition of Step 1."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 2 (move(d1, d2, peg3)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('clear', 'd2')' is used by the next step, Step 3 (move(d2, peg1, d3))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 produces effect '('clear', 'd2')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 3."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 2 (move(d1, d2, peg3)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 1 and Step 3",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 1 (which provides precondition '('clear', 'peg3')'). It must occur before Step 3 (which consumes effect '('clear', 'd2')')."

    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
