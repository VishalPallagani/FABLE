    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' potentially from the effect of Step 2 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' which is added by Step 2."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' from Step 2 (walk) still available for Step 3 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' added by Step 2 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (load-truck), is the effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck3')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 5)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck3')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 5, but it is deleted first by Step 5."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 4 (drive-truck) were skipped, would Step 5 (unload-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 4 removes effect '('at', 'truck3', 's4')', which is a precondition for Step 5."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 9 (unload-truck) and Step 4 (drive-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Step 4 deletes a precondition of Step 9."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 4 (drive-truck(truck3, s1, s4, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck3', 's4')' is used by the next step, Step 5 (unload-truck(package4, truck3, s4))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 4 produces effect '('at', 'truck3', 's4')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 5."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 2 (walk(driver1, s3, s1)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Before Step 3",
      "explanation": "No immediate preceding provider step found by this simple rule. It must occur before Step 3 (which consumes effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
