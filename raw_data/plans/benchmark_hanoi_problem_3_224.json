      "question": "In Step 3 (move), is the predicate '('clear', 'd2')' potentially from the effect of Step 2 (move) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('clear', 'd2')' which is added by Step 2."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('clear', 'd2')' from Step 2 (move) still available for Step 3 (move)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('clear', 'd2')' added by Step 2 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (move), is the effect '('clear', 'peg2')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 3)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('clear', 'peg2')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 3, but it is deleted first by Step 3."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 3 (move) were skipped, would Step 4 (move) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 3 removes effect '('clear', 'peg3')', which is a precondition for Step 4."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 4 (move) and Step 2 (move) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 3 (move(d2, peg3, peg2)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('clear', 'peg3')' is used by the next step, Step 4 (move(d1, d3, peg3))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 produces effect '('clear', 'peg3')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 4."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 3 (move(d2, peg3, peg2)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 2 and Step 4",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 2 (which provides precondition '('clear', 'd2')'). It must occur before Step 4 (which consumes effect '('clear', 'peg3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
