    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (debark), is the predicate '('on', 'c2')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('on', 'c2')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('on', 'c2')' from Step 1 (board) still available for Step 3 (debark)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('on', 'c2')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (board), is the effect '('on', 'c2')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 3)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('on', 'c2')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 3, but it is deleted first by Step 3."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 4 (sail) were skipped, would Step 5 (board) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 4 removes effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')', which is a precondition for Step 5."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 5 (board) and Step 2 (sail) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 4 (sail(l2, l1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')' is used by the next step, Step 5 (board(c1, l1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 4 produces effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 5."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 4 (sail(l2, l1)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 2 and Step 5",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 2 (which provides precondition '('at-ferry', 'l2')'). It must occur before Step 5 (which consumes effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
