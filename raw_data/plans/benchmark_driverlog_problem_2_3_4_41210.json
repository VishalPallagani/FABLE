  "benchmarks": {
    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 2 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 uses predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' from Step 1 (walk) still available for Step 2 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 2 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (walk), is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 2)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('at', 'driver1', 's2')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 2, but it is deleted first by Step 2."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 6 (load-truck) were skipped, would Step 7 (unload-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on direct effects, skipping Step 6 doesn't seem to remove any preconditions added solely by it for Step 7."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 7 (unload-truck) and Step 3 (drive-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 8 (drive-truck(truck1, s1, s4, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck1', 's4')' is used by the next step, Step 9 (unload-truck(package4, truck1, s4))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 8 produces effect '('at', 'truck1', 's4')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 9."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 5 (drive-truck(truck1, s4, s1, driver1)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 3 and Step 6",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 3 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck1', 's4')'). It must occur before Step 6 (which consumes effect '('at', 'truck1', 's1')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
