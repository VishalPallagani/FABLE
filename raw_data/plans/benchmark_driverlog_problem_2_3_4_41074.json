    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 4 (drive-truck), is the predicate '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board-truck) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 4 uses predicate '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' from Step 1 (board-truck) still available for Step 4 (drive-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 4 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (board-truck), is the effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 4)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 4 and not deleted before then."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 5 (load-truck) were skipped, would Step 6 (unload-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on direct effects, skipping Step 5 doesn't seem to remove any preconditions added solely by it for Step 6."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 3 (load-truck) and Step 2 (load-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 7 (drive-truck(truck1, s4, s3, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck1', 's3')' is used by the next step, Step 8 (unload-truck(package4, truck1, s3))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 7 produces effect '('at', 'truck1', 's3')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 8."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 9 (unload-truck(package3, truck1, s3)) must occur?",
      "answer": "After Step 7",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 7 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck1', 's3')'). No immediate subsequent consumer step found by this simple rule."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
