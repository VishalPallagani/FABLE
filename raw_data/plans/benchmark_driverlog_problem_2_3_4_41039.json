    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 2 (drive-truck), is the predicate '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board-truck) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 uses predicate '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' from Step 1 (board-truck) still available for Step 2 (drive-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 2 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (board-truck), is the effect '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 2)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck1')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 2 and not deleted before then."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 12 (unload-truck) were skipped, would Step 13 (drive-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on direct effects, skipping Step 12 doesn't seem to remove any preconditions added solely by it for Step 13."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 5 (drive-truck) and Step 13 (drive-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Step 5 deletes a precondition of Step 13. Step 13 deletes a precondition of Step 5."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 13 (drive-truck(truck1, s1, s2, driver2)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck1', 's2')' is used by the next step, Step 14 (unload-truck(package3, truck1, s2))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 13 produces effect '('at', 'truck1', 's2')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 14."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 5 (drive-truck(truck1, s1, s3, driver2)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 2 and Step 6",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 2 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck1', 's1')'). It must occur before Step 6 (which consumes effect '('at', 'truck1', 's3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
