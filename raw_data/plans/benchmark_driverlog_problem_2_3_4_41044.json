    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' potentially from the effect of Step 2 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' which is added by Step 2."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' from Step 2 (walk) still available for Step 3 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' added by Step 2 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (load-truck), is the effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck1')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 10)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('in', 'package4', 'truck1')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 10, but it is deleted first by Step 10."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 8 (unload-truck) were skipped, would Step 9 (drive-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Based on direct effects, skipping Step 8 doesn't seem to remove any preconditions added solely by it for Step 9."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 1 (load-truck) and Step 4 (drive-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Step 4 deletes a precondition of Step 1."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 9 (drive-truck(truck1, s1, s2, driver1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck1', 's2')' is used by the next step, Step 10 (unload-truck(package4, truck1, s2))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 9 produces effect '('at', 'truck1', 's2')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 10."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 6 (load-truck(package2, truck1, s4)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 4 and Step 11",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 4 (which provides precondition '('at', 'truck1', 's4')'). It must occur before Step 11 (which consumes effect '('in', 'package2', 'truck1')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
