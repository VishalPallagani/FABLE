    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' from Step 1 (walk) still available for Step 3 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (walk), is the effect '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 3)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('at', 'driver2', 's4')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 3, but it is deleted first by Step 3."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 7 (drive-truck) were skipped, would Step 8 (load-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 7 removes effect '('at', 'truck3', 's1')', which is a precondition for Step 8."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 8 (load-truck) and Step 12 (unload-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 10 (drive-truck(truck3, s1, s3, driver2)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at', 'truck3', 's3')' is used by the next step, Step 11 (unload-truck(package4, truck3, s3))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 10 produces effect '('at', 'truck3', 's3')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 11."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 3 (board-truck(driver2, truck3, s4)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Between Step 1 and Step 5",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 1 (which provides precondition '('at', 'driver2', 's4')'). It must occur before Step 5 (which consumes effect '('driving', 'driver2', 'truck3')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
