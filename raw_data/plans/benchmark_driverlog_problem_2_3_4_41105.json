    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 3 (board-truck), is the predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' potentially from the effect of Step 2 (walk) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 uses predicate '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' which is added by Step 2."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' from Step 2 (walk) still available for Step 3 (board-truck)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')' added by Step 2 appears available for Step 3 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (load-truck), is the effect '('in', 'package1', 'truck1')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 6)?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('in', 'package1', 'truck1')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 6, but it is deleted first by Step 6."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 2 (walk) were skipped, would Step 3 (board-truck) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 2 removes effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')', which is a precondition for Step 3."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 8 (unload-truck) and Step 7 (drive-truck) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 3 (board-truck(driver1, truck1, s1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')' is used by the next step, Step 4 (drive-truck(truck1, s1, s4, driver1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 produces effect '('driving', 'driver1', 'truck1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 4."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 2 (walk(driver1, s2, s1)) must occur?",
      "answer": "Before Step 3",
      "explanation": "No immediate preceding provider step found by this simple rule. It must occur before Step 3 (which consumes effect '('at', 'driver1', 's1')')."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
