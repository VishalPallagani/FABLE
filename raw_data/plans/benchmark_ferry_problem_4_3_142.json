    "Reaching Definitions": {
      "question": "In Step 2 (board), is the predicate '('at-ferry', 'l3')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (sail) being used?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 2 uses predicate '('at-ferry', 'l3')' which is added by Step 1."
    },
    "Available Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' from Step 1 (sail) still available for Step 2 (board)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Predicate effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' added by Step 1 appears available for Step 2 as no intermediate step seems to delete it."
    },
    "Live Variable Analysis": {
      "question": "After Step 1 (sail), is the effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' 'live' (i.e., needed by a future step like Step 2)?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Effect effect '('at-ferry', 'l3')' from Step 1 is needed by Step 2 and not deleted before then."
    },
    "Type-State Analysis": {
      "question": "If Step 3 (sail) were skipped, would Step 4 (debark) become invalid?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Skipping Step 3 removes effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')', which is a precondition for Step 4."
    },
    "Concurrency Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on simple precondition/delete analysis, can Step 3 (sail) and Step 5 (board) run concurrently?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "No direct precondition/delete conflicts found between these two steps with this basic check."
    },
    "Very Busy Expressions": {
      "question": "Is the action in Step 3 (sail(l3, l1)) 'very busy' in the sense that its effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')' is used by the next step, Step 4 (debark(c2, l1))?",
      "answer": "Yes",
      "explanation": "Step 3 produces effect '('at-ferry', 'l1')', which is immediately required as a precondition by Step 4."
    },
    "Interval Analysis": {
      "question": "Based on immediate dependencies in this linear plan, what constraints determine when Step 7 (debark(c0, l2)) must occur?",
      "answer": "After Step 6",
      "explanation": "It must occur after Step 6 (which provides precondition '('at-ferry', 'l2')'). No immediate subsequent consumer step found by this simple rule."
    },
    "Taint Analysis": {
      "question": "Does any step in this plan interfere with (taint) the preconditions of the immediately following step?",
      "answer": "No",
      "explanation": "No step found that directly deletes a precondition required by the immediately following step according to this rule."
