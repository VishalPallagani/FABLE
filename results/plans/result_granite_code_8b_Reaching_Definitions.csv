The predicate '(at-ferry, l2)' represents the location where a boat is currently located, and it does not depend on any previous actions or effects in the plan. Therefore, it cannot be potentially influenced by the effect of Step 1 (sail).

Question:
  In Step 3 (debark), is the predicate '('on', 'c0')' potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board) being used?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"Yes, it is possible for the predicate '(on, c0)' to be potentially from the effect of Step 1 (board) being used in the debark step. The definition of reaching definitions requires that a variable's definition must reach every program point where the variable appears, including through control flow or data dependencies. In this case, the boarding action at c0 is causing the predicate '(on, c0)' to be potentially true at l1, which could then influence the execution of subsequent steps and potentially lead to incorrect results if not properly handled. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the potential impact of the boarding action on the reaching definitions analysis in order to ensure accurate planning.
