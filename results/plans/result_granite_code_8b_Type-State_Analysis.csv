This is because the state of the objects in the environment changes as each move is made. In step 1, the disk d1 is moved from peg2 to d2, which means that it is no longer clear where it is located. Therefore, when step 2 is executed, it is no longer possible for d1 to be on peg2, since it has already been moved. This violates the requirement that each disk must be on a specific peg in order to be moved.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"Yes, the second move (step 2) would be invalid if the first move (step 1) were skipped. The first move moves disk d1 from peg1 to peg2, which means that the peg at position 1 is no longer available for placing or moving disks. Therefore, when the second move tries to move disk d3 from peg3 to peg1, it would be impossible because there is no longer a valid position for peg1 to place the disk. This would result in an invalid state of the system, as required by the type-state analysis.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"Yes, if step 2 (load-truck) were skipped, step 3 (drive-truck) would become invalid. This is because the load-truck step is a requirement for the drive-truck step to be valid. The load-truck step ensures that the package1 is present in the truck2 at the location s2, which is a requirement for the drive-truck step to be able to move the package1 from s2 to s3. If the load-truck step were skipped, then the package1 would not be present in the truck2 at the location s2, and the drive-truck step would become invalid.
