Question:
  Is the effect from Step 2, the driver getting on US 5, live at any point after Step 2?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 2 is live after that step. Let me break it down.

In the scenario, the driver is taking a route from Hartford Club in Hartford, CT to Igor Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport, CT. The steps are given as a list of directions.

Step 2 is ""Turn right onto US 5/Main Street."" So the driver gets on US 5 at this point. Now, the question is whether this action (getting on US 5) will have any effect that's still 'live' after Step 2. A live variable is one where its value is used again in the future before being discarded.

In data-flow analysis, variables are typically things like registers or memory locations. But here, it's about the driving route. So maybe we're looking at whether the action taken at Step 2 (entering US 5) affects any subsequent steps. 

Looking at the rest of the steps: after Step 2, they continue on US 5 for a few more turns and exits. Specifically, they take the US 5 ramp, exit onto I 91 South, then CT 15 South, and so on until they reach the destination.

Each step involves turning or taking an exit, which are actions based on the current road. So when the driver is on US 5 after Step 2, that's part of their route. The next steps involve driving on other roads, but each action is based on where they are at that moment.

Since the effect of being on US 5 directly leads to subsequent turns and exits, it's used again in future steps before being left behind. Therefore, the effect from Step 2 should be live.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 8, the driver getting on Beekman Street, live at any point after Step 10?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 8 is live after Step 10 in this travel route. Let me break it down.

First, let's understand what each step entails. The goal is to get from Our Lady of Mercy High School to St. Francis Hospital in Cincinnati. The steps provided are a series of turns and street changes. 

Step 8 says the driver gets on Beekman Street. Now, after that, at Step 10, the driver makes another right turn onto Queen City Avenue. I need to see if the action from Step 8 has any impact after Step 10.

In data-flow analysis, a live variable is one whose value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. Translating this to driving directions, it's about whether a step's instruction affects subsequent steps.

So, when the driver turns onto Beekman Street in Step 8, they might have their current position set there. Later, at Step 10, they turn right onto Queen City Avenue. Does getting onto Beekman Street in Step 8 influence anything after that?

I think about how turning onto a street sets your current location, but once you turn again, the previous streets aren't used anymore unless you need to reference them for another action, like making another turn or direction.

In this case, after Step 8, the driver is on Beekman Street. Then, at Step 10, they turn right onto Queen City Avenue. So, they're leaving Beekman Street. There's no indication that they use Beekman Street again after Step 10. They might be on it between steps, but once they turn off, the effect of being on Beekman Street doesn't seem to matter anymore.

Alternatively, maybe if there's a later instruction that uses the fact that they were on Beekman Street, like making another turn or direction based on their current street, then it would be live. But in this case, after Step 10, the instructions don't reference Beekman Street again except for staying on it between some steps.

Wait, looking back at Steps 9-11: After turning left to stay on Beekman Street (Step 9) and then another right turn (Step 10), they continue onto Queen City Avenue. So after Step 8, the driver is entering Beekman Street, but by Step 10, they've already turned off Beekman Street. So the effect of being on Beekman Street in Step 8 is no longer relevant after Step 10.

So, I think the effect from Step 8 isn't used again after Step 10, meaning it's not live.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on South Damen Avenue, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the variable from Step 3 is live after Step 8 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, let's understand what a ""live"" variable means in this context. The definition says a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So I need to see if the information from Step 3 is used again after Step 8.

Looking at the route steps provided:

Step 3: Turn right onto South Damen Avenue.
Step 8: Keep left to take I 90 West toward Wisconsin/Kennedy Expressway.

Now, I'll go through each step sequentially to track where the driver is and whether any use of South Damen Avenue occurs after Step 8.

From Step 1: Drive south on Ambulance Entrance. After this, there's a series of turns and highway exits. At Step 3, the driver turns right onto South Damen Avenue. Then, in Step 4, they make a left U-turn to stay on South Damen Avenue. So Steps 3 and 4 are both about being on South Damen.

After that, the route continues with turning right onto West Congress Parkway (Step 5), taking I-290 East (Step 6), then taking the I-90 West exit toward Wisconsin/Kennedy Expressway at Step 7. Then in Step 8, they keep left to take I-90 West again.

So from Step 3 and Step 4, the driver is on South Damen Avenue, but after that, the route moves away from it towards Congress Parkway and then onto the expressways. Now, the question is whether after Step 8, which is still on I-90 West, the value of being on South Damen Avenue is used again.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 8: they take several lefts and rights on I-90, then eventually turn onto Bobby E. Thompson Expressway, IL 137 North, Greenwood Avenue, Sheridan Road, and finally Shiloh Boulevard. There's no mention of going back to South Damen Avenue after Step 4.

So the variable indicating they were on South Damen Avenue (from Steps 3 and 4) isn't used again after Step 8. They leave South Damen at Step 5 onwards and never return to it later in the route.

Therefore, the effect from Step 3 is not used again after Step 8.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 4, the driver getting on Parkside Avenue, live at any point after Step 9?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 4 is live at any point after Step 9 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, what's a ""live variable"" again? It's a value that gets used again later before being discarded. So, I'm looking for if something from Step 4 affects anything after Step 9.

Looking at the steps:

Step 4: Make a left U-turn to stay on Parkside Avenue.

So, the driver is still on Parkside Avenue here. Now, the question is whether this action has any impact beyond that point until Step 9 or later.

Now, let's check the subsequent steps after Step 4:

- After Step 4, they turn left again (Step 5), then continue on NJ 29 South (Step 6). So, Parkside Avenue is being left for NJ 29. But does this action from Step 4 affect anything further? Maybe not directly, but let's see.

Looking at the entire route, after Step 9, things get more complex. At Step 10, they take exit 57B-A onto US 130 toward Bordentown. Then there are several exits and turns on US 130, then onto Burlington Pike and Farnsworth Avenue, etc., until arriving at the destination.

Wait, but does any of this later use Parkside Avenue again? Or is there any decision made based on the action taken in Step 4?

I think not. The driver moves past Parkside Avenue after Step 5. They take NJ 29 South, then exit onto I 295, US 130, etc., and eventually turn onto various other roads like Farnsworth and US 206. There's no mention of returning to Parkside Avenue or using that information again.

So, the effect from Step 4 is just a turn that leads them away from Parkside Avenue. Since they don't return there after Step 5, the variable (the action in Step 4) isn't used again later. Therefore, it's not live after Step 9.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 14, the driver getting on Lanark Road, live at any point after Step 17?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 14, where the driver gets onto Lanark Road, is live at any point after Step 17. First, I need to understand what ""live"" means in this context. From the benchmark definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded.

Looking at the route steps provided, each step involves turning left or right onto specific roads. Step 14 says 'Turn right onto Lanark Road.' So, after that, the driver is on Lanark Road. Now, I need to check if this state (being on Lanark Road) affects any subsequent steps up until Step 17.

Let me list out the steps from 14 onwards:

Step 14: Turn right onto Lanark Road.
Step 15: Keep left to take Union Street.
Step 16: Turn left onto South 3rd Street.
Step 17: Turn right onto Lanark Road.

Wait, Step 17 is another turn right onto Lanark Road. That means after being on South 3rd Street, the driver turns right back onto Lanark Road. So, the effect of Step 14 (being on Lanark Road) isn't immediately used again until Step 17. Does that mean the state from Step 14 is still relevant at Step 17?

But here's a thought: after Step 14, the driver is now on Lanark Road. Then, in Step 15, they keep left to take Union Street, so they exit Lanark Road. So, at Step 15, they're no longer on Lanark Road. That might mean that the state from Step 14 isn't used again until Step 17.

However, Step 17 brings them back onto Lanark Road. So, after Step 14, they were on Lanark Road, then left in Step 15, and then returned to Lanark Road at Step 17. Therefore, the effect of being on Lanark Road at Step 14 is used again at Step 17 when they turn right onto it again.

Wait, but does that mean that the state from Step 14 is still live? Because after Step 14, the driver was on Lanark Road, then left, and then came back. So, the fact that they were on Lanark Road before Step 15 might not directly affect anything until they return to it.

Alternatively, maybe the state of being on Lanark Road in Step 14 is no longer active because they've already turned off in Step 15. The only thing that matters is whether the effect (being on Lanark Road) is used again after Step 17.

Wait, let me re-examine the steps:

Step 14: Turn right onto Lanark Road.
Step 15: Keep left to take Union Street.
So, they're no longer on Lanark Road after Step 15.

Then at Step 17, they turn right onto Lanark Road again. So, the effect of being on Lanark Road in Step 14 is not used immediately but is reactivated later at Step 17.

Does that mean that the variable (being on Lanark Road) is live again at Step 17 because it's used again? Or does ""live"" refer to whether the value was set and then used again without being overwritten before?

I think in this context, since after Step 14, they leave Lanark Road in Step 15, that state is no longer active. The only time they're on Lanark Road again is at Step 17. So, the effect of Step 14 isn't directly influencing anything between Steps 15-16, but then at Step 17, they turn onto Lanark Road again.

Therefore, the state from Step 14 (being on Lanark Road) doesn't affect anything after that until Step 17, where they use it again. So, yes, it's used again in Step 17, making the effect live at that point.

Question:

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 9 is still alive after Step 13 in this travel route planning scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. Step 9 mentions entering Frankford Avenue after taking the 2nd exit. So, at this point, the driver is on Frankford Avenue. The question is whether this action (getting onto Frankford Avenue) has a live effect beyond Step 13.

Looking at the steps after Step 13: Step 14 talks about taking an exit towards Northeast Philadelphia Airport/Grant Avenue, then Steps 15 to 25 involve several turns and exits that eventually lead to the destination. So, from Step 9 onwards, Frankford Avenue is part of the route until it leads into the traffic circle and further exits.

Since Frankford Avenue is used before being overwritten or discarded when the driver exits onto another road, its effect isn't discarded immediately. The movement on Frankford Avenue is still relevant as it affects subsequent turns and exits, like Step 14 where the driver takes an exit from Frankford Avenue. Therefore, the effect of entering Frankford Avenue in Step 9 remains relevant until they leave it at Step 14.

So, yes, the effect from Step 9 is still live after Step 13 because the action on Frankford Avenue influences subsequent steps before being discarded.

  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on West Park Road, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 10 is live after Step 15 in this travel planning scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what ""live"" means here. The definition says a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So I need to see if any of the actions taken in Step 10 affect the route in any way that continues beyond Step 15.

Looking at Step 10: ""Turn right to stay on West Park Road."" This means the driver is staying on West Park Road after this turn. Now, I have to check subsequent steps to see if West Park Road is used again after Step 15.

Step 11 says: ""Bear left onto Perry Highway/US 19 South."" So from West Park Road, they bear left to Perry Highway. Then in Step 12: ""Turn right onto West Portersville Road/PA 488."" Next, Step 13: ""Bear left onto Mercer Road."" Step 14: ""Turn left onto PA 65."" Step 15: ""Turn right onto Bennetts Run Road/PA 588.""

After that, there's a series of turns on roads like PA 588 West, 7th Avenue, Steffens Hill Road, and others. I'm looking to see if West Park Road is used again after Step 15.

Wait, the initial action in Step 10 is turning right onto West Park Road, so that's the current road they're on. Then in Step 11, they bear left off of West Park Road. So the variable here would be whether the driver is still on West Park Road at any point after Step 15.

But from the steps given, after Step 10, they leave West Park Road in Step 11. The subsequent turns are all onto other roads: Perry Highway, PA 488, Mercer Road, PA 65, Bennetts Run Road, etc. None of these seem to take them back to West Park Road.

So, the effect of being on West Park Road in Step 10 is only during that step and then they move away from it. Since none of the steps after 15 bring them back, the variable isn't used again. Therefore, the answer should be ""No.""

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether the effect of getting on NH 10 in step 2 is still ""live"" after step 3. Let me break it down.

First, I should understand what a ""live variable"" is. From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, I think of each route step as a point in time where certain highway numbers (like NH 10) are active.

Looking at the steps:

- Step 2: The driver turns left onto NH 10 and continues on it.
- Step 3: They enter a roundabout and take the second exit toward NH 10 North, etc. So after step 3, they're still on NH 10 but moving towards NH 9.

Wait, no. After taking the second exit in step 3, are they still on NH 10? Or do they turn onto another highway? Let me read it again. The third step says ""take the 2nd exit toward NH 10 North/NH 12 North/Vermont."" So after that, they're turning right onto NH 9 in step 4. So at step 3, they're still on NH 10 but about to turn.

So, the variable here is NH 10. Is its effect live after step 3? Well, the value of being on NH 10 is used until they exit it in step 4. So after step 3, they are still on NH 10, so the effect is ongoing. Therefore, it's still live.

I think that means yes, because the variable (NH 10) is still active after step 3 until they leave it.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 4, the driver getting on I 480, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the action in step 4, which is taking the I 480 West ramp, affects anything after step 8 in the given travel route. Let me break this down.

First, I'll list out all the steps again to keep track:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn right onto Sagamore Road/TR 1. Continue on Sagamore Road.
3. Turn left onto Northfield Road/SR 8.
4. Take the I 480 West ramp toward Cleveland/Toledo.
5. Keep right to stay on I 480 West.
6. Keep left to take SR 10 West/State Route 10 toward Norwalk/Oberlin.
7. Take the SR 57/US 20 East/SR 301 North exit on the right toward Medina/Elyria.
8. Keep left to take US 20 West.
9. Take the SR 511 exit on the right toward Oberlin.
10. Turn right onto Oberlin Elyria Road.
11. Turn left onto West 2nd Street.
12. Continue for 11 meters or 3 seconds.
13. Destination is on the left.

The question is whether step 4's action (getting on I 480) affects anything after step 8, specifically at any point after that step. So, step 8 is where they keep left to take US 20 West. After that, step 9 involves taking SR 511 exit toward Oberlin. Then steps continue with turning right and left onto various roads leading to the destination.

I need to think about if the initial action of getting on I 480 has any impact later on. So, when you take the I 480 West ramp at step 4, that sets the direction for I-480. They keep right in step 5, then keep left in step 6 to get onto SR 10. Then in step 7, they exit via SR 57/US 20 toward Elyria and Medina.

After that, step 8 is keeping left to take US 20 West, so perhaps from there, they might be heading west towards Oberlin or Elyria. Step 9 takes the SR 511 exit on the right toward Oberlin, which would mean turning right onto SR 511, then proceeding to Oberlin.

So, the initial action in step 4 sets the path via I-480 West, but after that, the route diverts from I-480 at step 6 and continues west on SR 10 and then SR 57 towards Elyria. Then, step 8 is keeping left onto US 20 West, which might be a different road than I-480. So, maybe the initial I-480 usage doesn't affect anything after step 8 because the route has already moved away from I-480 by step 6.

Wait, but step 4 is taking the ramp onto I-480, so that would mean they are on I-480 until step 6 when they keep left to take SR 10 West. So, in step 4 and 5, they're on I-480, then in step 6, they exit. After that, they go through several more steps: exiting onto SR 57/US 20 East towards Medina/Elyria, then keeping left for US 20 West, taking the SR 511 exit toward Oberlin, turning right and left into Oberlin Elyria Road, etc.

So, step 4 is the driver getting on I-480. After that, in step 8, they are on US 20 West. Now, I need to see if any of the actions after step 8 involve returning to I-480 or if there's a usage of the I-480 route again later.

Looking at the steps after step 8:

9. Take SR 511 exit on the right toward Oberlin.
10. Turn right onto Oberlin Elyria Road.
11. Turn left onto West 2nd Street.
12. Continue for 11 meters or 3 seconds.
13. Destination is on the left.

None of these steps mention anything about I-480 again. So, after step 6, they are no longer on I-480; instead, they've exited and taken other routes. Therefore, the action in step 4 doesn't affect any point after step 8 because by then, the driver has already left I-480.

So, putting it all together, the effect from step 4 (getting on I-480) is only while they're on that highway until they exit at step 6. After that, their route doesn't involve I-480 again. Therefore, there's no live variable effect after step 8.

  Is the effect from Step 15, the driver getting on Market Street, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the variable 'Market Street' is live after Step 15 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a ""live variable"" means according to the benchmark given. A variable is considered live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking to see if 'Market Street' appears again after Step 15.

Looking at the route steps provided:

Step 15: Turn right onto Market Street.

After that, let me list out the subsequent steps to check for any mention of Market Street:

16. Keep right to stay on Market Street.
17. Turn right onto South Main Street/MA 1A/MA 133.
18. Keep right to stay on MA 1A/MA 133.
19. Turn left onto Argilla Road.
20. Turn left after 3571 meters or 233-285 seconds.
21. Continue for 113 meters or 16-19 seconds.
22. Your destination is on the left.

So, from Step 15 to Step 17, 'Market Street' is mentioned again in Step 16 and Step 17. Wait, actually, after Step 15, Step 16 says ""Keep right to stay on Market Street."" Then Step 17 says ""Turn right onto South Main Street/MA..."" So, after turning onto Market Street at Step 15, they keep going on it until Step 17.

So, 'Market Street' is used again in Step 16 and 17. That means the variable representing Market Street is being used again later in the route. Therefore, it's live after Step 15 because its value is used in Steps 16 and 17 before being overwritten when they turn onto South Main Street.

Wait, but does ""staying on Market Street"" count as using the variable? I think so because the action of staying on it implies that the street is still active. So yes, the variable is definitely live again after Step 15.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 8, the driver getting on West Main Street, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 8 in the travel route is ""live"" after that step. Let me break it down.

First, the goal is to determine if a variable (in this case, the action of turning onto West Main Street) is live. That means its value or effect should be used again later before being discarded.

Looking at the steps provided:

1. Drive west.
2. Turn left onto Forest Street.
3. Turn left onto Capitol Avenue.
4. Take the I 84 West ramp toward Waterbury.
5. Keep left on I 84 West/Yankee Expressway.
6. Take exit 18 on the right toward West Main Street.
7. Keep left toward West Main Street.
8. Turn right onto West Main Street.
9. Continue for 783 meters or about 51-63 seconds.
10. Arrive at destination.

So, Step 8 is turning right onto West Main Street. The next step, Step 9, says to continue on that street for a certain distance and time before arriving at the destination in Step 10.

I think the key here is whether after Step 8, there's any further use of being on West Main Street. Since Step 9 continues on that street and then arrives, it seems like the action from Step 8 (turning onto West Main Street) is indeed used again later. Therefore, the effect of Step 8 is live because it's utilized in subsequent steps.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect of Step 1 is live at any point after Step 4 in the given travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive northeast on Columbia Road.
2. Turn right to stay on Columbia Road.
3. Turn right onto Saint Johns Lane.
4. Turn right onto Long Gate Parkway.
5. Turn left to take the ramp toward MD 100 East.
6. Take exit 5B on the right onto I 95 North toward Baltimore.
7. Keep left to take I 95 North (left tunnel).
8. Take exit 61 on the right onto US 40 East toward Pulaski Highway.

15. Turn left after 397 meters or 64-78 seconds.
16. Continue for 60 meters or 9-11 seconds.
17. You have arrived at your destination.

The question is whether the effect from Step 1 (getting on Columbia Road) is live at any point after Step 4. So, I need to determine if there's a use of the variable representing being on Columbia Road after step 4.

In data-flow analysis, a variable is considered live if its value is used again in the future. So here, we're looking for whether, after turning onto Long Gate Parkway (Step 4), there's any further use of the fact that the driver was on Columbia Road.

Looking at the steps after Step 4, the route goes through several turns and highways: I-95 North, US 40 East, MD 700 South, MD 150 East, Wilson Point Road, Strawberry Point Road, etc., until arriving at the destination. There's no mention of returning to Columbia Road or using any information about having been there again.

Each step seems to describe a turn or movement from one road to another without referring back to previous roads unless necessary for navigation, which isn't the case here. The only possible reference is in Step 2 where they stay on Columbia Road after turning right, but that's just part of the initial route and not a reuse of the variable.

So, I think there's no live use of the fact that the driver was on Columbia Road after Step 4 because the subsequent steps don't refer back to it. Therefore, the effect from Step 1 isn't used again later.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on MN 3, live at any point after Step 6?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, so I need to determine if the effect from Step 3, where the driver gets on MN 3, is still live after Step 6. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's outline the route steps provided:

1. Drive south on Manitou Street North.
2. Turn left onto Saint Olaf Avenue West.
3. Get on MN 3 (Water Street North).
4. Enter a roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto MN 3/2nd Avenue Northwest.
5. Turn right onto MN 3/20th Street Northwest.
6. Turn left onto I 35 BUS/MN 21/Lyndale Avenue North.
7. Turn right onto Highway 60 West/MN 60/I 35 ALT and continue on MN 60.
8. Bear right to stay on MN 60.
9. Take the MN 60 exit toward Mankato/North Mankato.
10. Turn right onto 290th Street/CR 58.
11. Continue on CR 58 for a certain distance or time.
12. Destination is on the right.

The question is whether the effect from Step 3 (getting on MN 3) is live after Step 6.

First, I need to understand what ""live variable"" means in this context. A live variable is one whose value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, if a step assigns a value that is later used again, it's considered live.

Step 3: The driver gets on MN 3. This action likely sets some part of the route to MN 3, which is then followed by other steps involving MN 3 exits and intersections (Steps 4, 5). So, at Step 3, the variable representing MN 3 is assigned a value that will be used again in future steps.

After Step 6: Let's see what happens after Step 6. Step 7 continues on MN 60, which was entered in Step 6 (turning right onto Highway 60/MN 60). So, MN 60 is being followed through Steps 7 and 8, and then at Step 9, the driver exits onto 290th Street/CR 58.

Now, the question is whether the effect from Step 3 (MN 3) is used again after Step 6. After Step 6, the route shifts to MN 60, which isn't directly connected to MN 3 in the subsequent steps listed here. However, it's possible that MN 3 might be referenced again later beyond Step 12, but within the provided steps up to Step 12, there's no indication of using MN 3 again after Step 5.

Wait, let me check again. After Step 6 (turning left onto I 35 BUS/MN 21/Lyndale Avenue North), the next step is turning right onto Highway 60/MN 60 (Step 7). Then, they continue on MN 60 through Steps 8 and 9, exiting onto CR 58 in Step 10. The rest of the steps involve continuing on CR 58.

So, after Step 6, the route moves away from MN 3 towards I 35 BUS/MN 21/Lyndale Avenue North, then to Highway 60, and finally to CR 58. There's no mention of returning to MN 3 or using it again in the subsequent steps provided. Therefore, the effect of Step 3 (getting on MN 3) isn't used again after Step 6 within the given route.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the roundabout at Step 4. They took the second exit onto MN 3/2nd Avenue Northwest. So, that's still on MN 3, right? Wait, but in Step 5, they turn right onto MN 3/20th Street Northwest. So, they're continuing on MN 3 until Step 6, where they turn left onto I 35 BUS/MN 21/Lyndale Avenue North.

So, from Steps 3 to 6, the driver is on MN 3. After that, in Step 7 and onwards, they move away from MN 3 onto Highway 60 and CR 58.

Therefore, the effect of getting on MN 3 at Step 3 is used until Step 6, after which it's no longer needed. So, after Step 6, the value assigned in Step 3 (MN 3) isn't referenced again. Therefore, it wouldn't be considered live after Step 6.

But wait, let me clarify: Is the effect from Step 3 still relevant or used again after Step 6? Since after Step 6, they leave MN 3 and move onto I 35 BUS/MN 21/Lyndale Avenue North, then to Highway 60, etc., the value of being on MN 3 isn't used again. So, the variable representing MN 3 is no longer referenced after Step 6.

Therefore, the answer would be No, because the effect from Step 3 isn't used again after Step 6.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 15, the driver getting on Market Street, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 15 in the travel route is ""live"" after that step. Let me break it down.

Step 15 says the driver turns right onto Market Street and continues for 157 meters or about 13-16 seconds. The question is asking if any of the subsequent steps use the information from this action, meaning if Market Street usage affects anything after Step 15.

Looking at the route steps after Step 15: Step 16 mentions bearing right onto Topsfield Road, followed by more turns and exits onto Ipswich Road and then the destination on Market Street. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because Step 15 is already on Market Street, but Step 17 also says ""Continue for 157 meters or 13-16 seconds"" which might be part of the same action as Step 15.

Wait, perhaps I misread it. Let me check again. The steps are numbered from 0 to 15? Wait no, the list starts with 'Drive south.' and then goes up to Step 14 and Step 15. Let me recount:

1. Drive south.
2. Turn left onto Linnaean Street.
3. Turn left onto Massachusetts Avenue/MA 2A.
4. Turn right onto Somerville Avenue.
5. Turn left onto Union Square.
6. Bear right onto MA 28/McGrath Highway. Continue on MA 28.
7. Turn left onto Charlestown Avenue.
8. Take the New Rutherford Avenue exit on the right.
9. Take the US 1 North ramp on the right toward Tobin Bridge.
10. Keep right to take I 95 North toward Portsmouth New Hampshire.
11. Take exit 70 on the right onto US 1 toward Topsfield.
12. Keep right to stay on US 1.
13. Turn right onto Ipswich Road.
14. Bear right onto Topsfield Road.
15. Bear right onto Market Street.
16. Continue for 157 meters or 13-16 seconds.
17. Your destination is on the right.

Wait, so Step 15 is ""Bear right onto Market Street."" Then Step 16 is continuing for some distance, and Step 17 is reaching the destination on Market Street. So after Step 15, the driver is still on Market Street until the end.

So any variables related to being on Market Street from Step 15 would be used again at Step 17 when they reach their destination. Therefore, that effect is indeed live because it's used later in the journey.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 7 is live after Step 12 in this travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step represents. The steps are directions given to navigate from Monroe County Hospital to Rankin House. Each step involves a turn or a direction that affects the driver's path.

Step 7 says ""Turn right onto US 41/GA 7/GA 18."" So at this point, the driver is getting on GA 18 again after possibly taking another route for a bit. The key here is whether GA 18's effect is live beyond Step 12.

Looking at the steps, Step 12 is ""Turn right toward Waverly Hall."" After that, there are more turns and continues until the destination is reached. So I need to see if GA 18 is used again after Step 12.

From the route steps, after Step 7, GA 18 is mentioned a few times. For example, in Step 8, it's ""Continue on GA 18."" Then in Step 10, ""Turn right onto South Main Street/GA 18/GA 74/GA 109."" So that keeps GA 18 active. Later, in Step 12, the driver is turning right toward Waverly Hall, but I'm not sure if that's exiting GA 18 or continuing on it.

Wait, actually, after Step 7, the driver is on GA 18 and continues on it through Step 8. Then in Step 10, they turn onto South Main Street, which also intersects with GA 18, so the effect of being on GA 18 might still be active because the address or the route could reference it again later.

In Step 12, turning right toward Waverly Hall doesn't necessarily mean leaving GA 18; it could still be on that road. Then in the final step, the destination is on the left, which would mean they're continuing on the current road, likely GA 18 or another highway that's part of GA 18.

So even after Step 12, there might still be parts where GA 18 is being used because the route continues on it until the destination. Therefore, the effect from Step 7 (getting onto GA 18) would still be live at points after Step 12.

Alright, let's try to figure out whether the effect from Step 7 is live after Step 10 in this travel route scenario.

First, I need to understand what ""live variable analysis"" means here. From the benchmark, a live variable is one whose value is used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking to see if the action taken at Step 7 (getting on Andover Bypass) affects any subsequent steps after Step 10.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 1: Drive north.
...
Step 7: Take the exit on the right after 41 meters or 2-3 seconds. Then, bear right onto Andover Bypass/MA 125 South and continue on MA 125.
Step 8: Take the I 93 South ramp on the right toward Boston.
... up to Step 10.

Wait, what's the exact sequence? Let me list them out more clearly:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn left after 44m/7-9s.
3. Turn right onto Webster Street.
4. Make a sharp left onto Kenoza Avenue/MA 110.
5. Turn left onto Main Street/MA 110/125.
6. Turn left onto MA 114 East/125 South/Turnpike Street.
7. Keep right to take Andover Bypass/MA 125 South.
8. Take the exit on the right after 41m/2-3s.
9. Bear right onto Andover Bypass/MA 125. Continue on MA 125.
10. Take the I 93 South ramp on the right toward Boston.

So, Step 7 is about taking the Andover Bypass, and then in Step 8, they take an exit which leads to more of MA 125. Then in Step 9, continuing on MA 125. Step 10 involves taking the I-93 South ramp.

I think the key here is whether the action at Step 7 (getting onto Andover Bypass) affects any steps after Step 10. After Step 10, they take the I-93 South ramp, which might change direction or lead to different roads. 

Since the driver continues on MA 125 and then takes the I-93 ramp, it's possible that the initial turn at Step 7 influences their path through Andover Bypass before merging onto I-93. But does this action directly affect anything after Step 10? Well, in Step 9 they're still on MA 125, so maybe not yet. However, when they take the exit and change to Andover Bypass, that might influence their next moves, but by Step 10, they've already taken the ramp onto I-93.

Wait, no. After Step 7, they continue on MA 125 (Step 9), then in Step 10, they take the I-93 South ramp. So, the effect from Step 7 is still present as they're on Andover Bypass until they merge onto I-93. Therefore, the decision at Step 7 affects their path up to when they merge with I-93, which happens before Step 10. But after merging, it's a different highway.

Wait, no—Step 10 is taking the ramp onto I-93. So, by Step 9, they're still on MA 125 and Andover Bypass. Then in Step 10, they take the ramp to I-93. So, the initial turn at Step 7 is part of the process that leads them to take the I-93 ramp at Step 10.

Therefore, the effect from Step 7 (getting onto Andover Bypass) influences their position when they reach Step 10 because it's part of the route that leads to taking the I-93 ramp. So, the action in Step 7 is still being used or influencing the actions up to and including Step 10.

Therefore, the answer should be Yes.

Given the following travel planning scenario:

  Goal: Muskegon County Airport (MUSKEGON, MI) to Holland Reformed Protestant Dutch Church (Holland, MI)

Continue on Pine Street.', 'Take the US 31 South ramp toward Grand Haven.', 'Turn right onto 136th Avenue.', 'Turn left to stay on 136th Avenue.', 'Bear left onto North River Avenue.', 'Turn left onto West 3rd Street.', 'Turn right onto Central Avenue.', 'Turn left onto East 10th Street.', 'Turn left after 125 meters or 12-15 seconds.', 'Continue for 10 meters or 4-5 seconds.', 'You have arrived at your destination.']

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 19, the driver getting on 136th Avenue, live at any point after Step 21?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 19 is still ""live"" after Step 21 in this travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a ""live variable"" is. From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, I think it refers to whether the action taken at Step 19 (getting on 136th Avenue) affects any subsequent steps after Step 21.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 19: ""Turn left to stay on 136th Avenue."" So, the driver is turning left onto 136th Avenue.

Then, Steps 20 to 21 are:
20. Bear left onto North River Avenue.
21. Turn left onto West 3rd Street.

Now, I need to see if after Step 21, any part of the route that was affected by being on 136th Avenue is still relevant or used again.

After Step 21, the driver is turning left onto West 3rd Street. Now, the next steps are:

22. Turn right onto Central Avenue.
23. Turn left onto East 10th Street.
24. Turn left after 125 meters...
25. Continue for 10 meters...
26. Arrived at destination.

I don't see any further use of 136th Avenue after Step 19, except that the driver is staying on it in Step 19 and then turning left into North River Avenue (Step 20). So, after leaving 136th Avenue, the route continues onto West 3rd Street and other streets.

Since the effect at Step 19 is just the action of being on 136th Avenue, which doesn't directly influence any further steps beyond Step 21 except for turning left in Step 20. However, that turn seems to be part of the movement from 136th Avenue to North River Avenue, but after that point, the route continues without revisiting or needing the action taken at Step 19.

Therefore, I think the effect from Step 19 isn't used again after Step 21.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 30, the driver getting on Old Troy Road, live at any point after Step 34?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 30 is live at any point after Step 34 in this travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, what's a ""live variable"" in this context? From the definition given, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm guessing this has to do with whether a certain action or state (like being on Old Troy Road) happens again later in the route.

Looking at the steps provided:

Step 30: Turn left onto State Route 162/IL 162. Continue on IL 162.
Step 31: Turn right onto South Main Street.
Step 32: Turn left onto Oak Hill School Road.
... and so on until Step 34.

I need to check if anything after Step 30 uses Old Troy Road again. Let's go through the steps from 30 onwards carefully.

At Step 30, they're turning left onto IL 162 and continuing on it. Then at Step 33, they turn right onto South Main Street. That doesn't seem related.

Step 34: Turn left onto Oak Hill School Road. No mention of Old Troy here.

Moving forward from Step 34:

Step 35: Turn right onto Rieder Road.
Step 36: Turn left onto Wherry Road.
Step 37: Bear right onto Pryor Road.
Step 38: Turn left onto East Drive.
Step 39: Turn left onto McCullough Road.
Step 40: Continue for a bit, then Step 41: Destination is on the right.

None of these steps mention Old Troy Road again after Step 30. So, the action in Step 30 (turning left onto IL 162) doesn't seem to be used again later. Therefore, its effect isn't live after Step 34.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 9, the driver getting on US 250, live at any point after Step 13?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 9, where the driver gets on US 250, is still 'live' at any point after Step 13 in this travel route. First, I need to understand what 'live' means here. From the definition given, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded.

Looking at the steps provided, each step describes a turn or action taken during the drive. Step 9 says ""Turn right onto US 250/ SR 13/East League Street."" So, the driver is getting onto US 250 here. Now, I need to see if this action has any effect after Step 13.

Step 13 is ""Turn right onto SR 96."" After that, the route continues with more turns and actions until it reaches the destination at the end. The key is whether the fact of being on US 250 at Step 9 affects anything that happens beyond Step 13.

I should think about how each step might influence future actions. At Step 9, the driver enters US 250, which might affect subsequent turns or directions taken later. But as the route progresses through Steps 10 to 13 and onwards, it's making various right and left turns onto different roads like SR 13, SR 96, etc.

I need to check if any of these future steps depend on having been on US 250 earlier. For example, maybe a turn is based on being on that road. However, once the driver leaves US 250 at Step 9, they're moving onto other roads like SR 13 and then SR 96. The actions after that don't seem to refer back to US 250.

Wait, but Step 10 mentions continuing on US 250/SR 13. So after Step 9, the driver is still on US 250 until possibly turning off later. But in this case, they turn right onto SR 13 at Step 11 and continue on it until Step 12. Then, at Step 13, they turn right onto SR 96.

Since the effect of being on US 250 occurs when they're actually driving on it, but after that, they move off US 250 into other roads. The question is whether this action (getting on US 250) has any live effect after Step 13.

I think the term 'live' refers to whether the variable (in this case, the state of being on US 250) is used again in the future steps before it's no longer relevant. Once they leave US 250 at Step 9 or continue on it but then turn off later, does that influence any subsequent action?

Looking at Steps 10-13 and beyond, the actions are about turning right, left, taking exits, etc., but not specifically referring back to having been on US 250. So perhaps the effect of being on US 250 doesn't reappear after Step 9.

Wait, but after Step 9, they continue on US 250 until Step 12, where they turn right onto SR 13. Then at Step 11, they keep left and continue on US 250/SR 13, then at Step 12, they turn right to stay on SR 13. So perhaps the variable of being on US 250 is active during these steps.

But the question is whether this effect is live after Step 13. After Step 13, which is turning onto SR 96, do any of the subsequent steps use the fact that they were on US 250?

The remaining steps involve more turns and eventually arriving at the destination. There's no indication that being on US 250 affects these later actions.

Therefore, once the driver leaves US 250 after Step 12 or continues past it without using its state again, the effect would not be live anymore. So the answer is No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on Third Street, live at any point after Step 11?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 11 is live after that step. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, let's list out all the steps given:

1. Drive southwest.
2. Turn right onto Access Road.
3. Bear right onto Boston-Providence Turnpike/US 1. Continue on US 1.
4. Take the I 95 South ramp on the right toward Canton/Providence Rhode Island.
5. Keep left to take exit 26 onto I 93 North/US 1 toward Boston.
6. Keep left to stay on US 1 toward Boston.
7. Keep right to take I 93 North toward Concord NH.
8. Take exit 24 on the right onto MA 28 toward Fellsway West/Winchester.
9. Enter Roosevelt Circle and take the 2nd exit toward MA 28 South/Fellsway West/Malden.
10. Keep left to stay on MA 28.
11. Turn right onto Third Street.
12. Continue for 29 meters or 6-8 seconds.
13. Destination is on the left.

The question is whether, after Step 11, when the driver turns onto Third Street (Step 11), is there any point in the subsequent steps where this action still has an effect. So, after Step 11, do any of the later steps use the fact that the driver took Third Street?

Looking at Steps 12 and 13: After turning onto Third Street, they continue for a short distance and then reach the destination on the left. That seems to be the endpoint.

So, Step 11 is about turning onto Third Street. The next step (Step 12) continues on Third Street, and then in Step 13, the destination is on the left after that. 

Now, considering live variables: a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, the action of turning onto Third Street (Step 11) affects the current street being driven on. So, Step 12 continues on Third Street, which directly follows from Step 11.

Therefore, the effect of Step 11 is still active in Step 12, as they are on Third Street. So yes, there's a use of that action after Step 11.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on WA 104, live at any point after Step 9?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 6 is live after Step 9 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. The route starts with driving south on Lilly Lane and continues through several turns and roads. Step 6 mentions getting onto WA 104/State Route 104 and continuing on it. Then, as we go further into the steps, the driver takes various turns and eventually arrives at the destination.

The question is about whether the action in Step 6 (getting onto WA 104) has an effect that's still active after Step 9. So I need to see if the variable representing being on WA 104 is used again after Step 9.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 9, which are Steps 10 through the end, I notice that eventually, the driver arrives at Bremerton National Airport. The last few steps mention turning right after a certain distance and continuing until arrival.

I need to check if there's any point after Step 9 where the driver is still on WA 104. Let me recount: After Step 6, they continue on WA 104. Then in Step 8, they turn right onto Bond Road Northeast/WA 307, so they're leaving WA 104 here. So from Step 7 to Step 8, they are still on WA 104.

Wait, but Step 9 is the next step after turning right onto Bond Road Northeast. So Step 6 is at position 6, and Step 9 is position 9. The question is whether the effect (being on WA 104) from Step 6 is live after Step 9.

From Step 6, they continue on WA 104 through Steps 7 and 8, but by Step 9, they've turned onto Bond Road Northeast/WA 307. Therefore, after Step 9, they are no longer on WA 104. So the effect from Step 6 stops being relevant after Step 8.

But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes effects can linger or be used again in certain ways. Let me think about how live variables work. A variable is live if its value is used again before being discarded. In this case, getting on WA 104 is an event at Step 6. If that event affects the route beyond that point, it's live.

Since after leaving WA 104, they take other roads, but the arrival is at the airport. There's no indication that WA 104 is used again later. So the effect from Step 6 isn't used again after Step 9, meaning it's not live anymore.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 18, the driver getting on Polk Street, live at any point after Step 18?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 18 is a live variable in the travel route provided. The question is asking if the driver getting on Polk Street at Step 18 has a live effect after that point.

First, I need to understand what ""live"" means in this context. From the benchmark definition, a live variable is one whose value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking for whether Polk Street's usage is referenced again later in the route.

Looking at the steps, Step 18 is where the driver turns right onto Polk Street and continues for 152 meters or about 19-23 seconds. The destination is on the right after that. Now, I need to check if Polk Street is mentioned again after Step 18.

Skimming through the subsequent steps, I don't see any mention of Polk Street beyond Step 18. The route proceeds from Polk Street to Water Street and then continues on various highways, but no further references to Polk Street. Therefore, Polk Street's usage doesn't seem to be used again after Step 18.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through the steps again more carefully. After Step 18, the route goes from Polk Street to Water Street at Step 20. So, Polk Street is only used once, in Step 18, and isn't referenced again later on.

So, since Polk Street's effect isn't used again after Step 18, it wouldn't be considered a live variable here.

Then, in subsequent steps, the driver continues on CA 210, takes another exit to I 215 North towards Barstow (Step 14), then proceeds through several exits and turns until arriving at the destination.

I need to see if any part of Step 10 is referenced or affects any step after Step 15. 

Looking through Steps 11 to 17, the driver continues on CA 210, then takes exit 74 onto I 215 North, then keeps left for I 15 North, then right for I 40/Needles Freeway, and finally takes exit 12 towards Barstow-Dagget Airport. 

So, after Step 10, the driver is on CA 210, which continues to be used until taking exit 74. Therefore, the action at Step 10 (entering CA 210) directly affects the path taken in Steps 11-14, where they remain on CA 210 before exiting onto I 215.

Therefore, the effect from Step 10 is still being utilized through Steps 11 to 14. So, after Step 15, which is the step where the driver takes exit 12 towards the airport, it's clear that the initial action at Step 10 was used in subsequent steps. 

So yes, the effect from Step 10 is live even after Step 15.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 4, the driver getting on Crossgates Boulevard, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 4 is live at any point after Step 8 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what each step entails:

Step 4: The driver turns right onto Crossgates Boulevard.
Step 8: The driver takes exit 154B on the right onto MS 39 North toward DeKalb.

Now, I need to determine if the action in Step 4 (getting on Crossgates Blvd) is used again after Step 8. So, the question is whether after Step 8, there's any use of the fact that the driver was on Crossgates Blvd.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 8:
Step 9: Turn right onto Dale Drive/MS 39/ MS 884.
Step 10: Bear left onto MS 39 N/MS 39. Continue on MS 39.
Step 11: Turn right onto John C. Stennis Drive/MS 854.
Step 12: Turn right onto Fuller Road.
Steps 13-14: Continue for a certain distance/time, and the destination is on the right.

I don't see any mention of Crossgates Blvd after Step 4, but wait, in Step 10, it says ""Bear left onto MS 39 N/MS 39. Continue on MS 39."" Hmm, does this refer back to a previous point where they were on MS 39? Or is it just continuing from another part?

Wait, Step 8 mentions turning onto MS 39 North toward DeKalb, and then in Step 9, turning right onto Dale Drive/MS 39. So after Step 8, they go onto MS 39 again in Step 10.

But the initial question is about whether Crossgates Blvd (from Step 4) is used again after Step 8. From Steps 9-14, the driver is moving from MS 39 to Dale Drive and then further. There's no indication that they return back to Crossgates Blvd or use any of its characteristics again.

Wait, but in Step 10, it says ""Bear left onto MS 39 N/MS 39. Continue on MS 39."" So perhaps after leaving Crossgates Blvd in Step 4, the driver later goes back to MS 39 via Dale Drive (Step 9) and then continues on MS 39 again. So does this mean that they used MS 39 again after Step 8? But the question is specifically about whether the effect from Step 4 (Crossgates Blvd) is live.

Wait, no. The effect from Step 4 would be any use of the information that they were on Crossgates Blvd beyond that step. If they don't go back to it or refer to it again after Step 4, then it's not live. But if in later steps, they do something because they had been on Crossgates Blvd, like taking a certain route because they came from there, but the instructions here don't mention that.

Looking at all the steps after Step 8, there's no reference to Crossgates Blvd again. They go onto MS 39 North (Step 8), then turn right onto Dale Drive/MS 39 (Step 9), and continue on MS 39 (Step 10). So it seems like they are just continuing their journey on MS 39 without any mention of returning or using information from Crossgates Blvd.

Therefore, the effect from Step 4 isn't used again after Step 8. So the answer should be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on I 93, live at any point after Step 12?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 6 is live at any point after Step 12 in the given travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, understanding what each step does. Step 6 says ""Take the I 93 South ramp on the right."" That means the driver is getting onto Interstate 93 heading south. Now, from the definition provided, a variable is live if its value is used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, I need to check if the action taken at Step 6 affects any of the subsequent steps up until Step 12.

Looking at the route steps:

1. Drive southeast.
2. Turn right onto Pleasant Street/US 202/NH 9.
3. Turn left onto South Street/NH 13.
4. Turn left onto Broadway.
5. Turn right onto South Main Street/NH 3A.
6. Take I-93 South ramp on the right.
7. Keep left to stay on I-93 South/Everett Turnpike.
8. Keep right to stay on I-93 South toward Salem/Boston.
9. Take exit 9S on the right onto US 3 South/NH 28 South toward Manchester.
10. Turn left onto Beech Street/NH 28.
11. Bear left onto Brown Avenue/NH 3A.
12. Enter Airport Road and take the 2nd exit onto Galaxy Way.

Now, Step 6 is getting on I-93. After that, the driver continues on I-93 South for several steps until taking exit 9S towards Manchester at Step 9. So, the action of entering I-93 at Step 6 affects all the steps where they remain on I-93, which are Steps 7 and 8.

At Step 9, the driver exits I-93, so the effect of being on I-93 no longer continues beyond that point. Now, from Step 10 onwards, the route changes to local streets and Galaxy Way, which is after exiting I-93.

Therefore, the effect of being on I-93 at Step 6 (Step 6's action) is only until the driver exits at Step 9. After that, the driver is no longer on I-93, so any further steps after Step 12 would not be affected by the initial entrance onto I-93.

Wait, but the question specifically asks whether the effect from Step 6 is live at any point after Step 12. So, if the effect of Step 6 (entering I-93) is still present beyond Step 12, then it's considered live. But since the driver has already exited I-93 by Step 9, and Steps 10 to 12 are on local streets and Galaxy Way, which aren't part of I-93 anymore.

Therefore, after Step 12, the effect of being on I-93 from Step 6 is no longer present because the driver has already left that highway. So, the effect isn't live beyond Step 12.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on State Highway 37, live at any point after Step 5?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 3 is considered live at any point after Step 5 in the given travel route scenario. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding what a ""live"" variable is: from the definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, each step probably represents an action taken at that point, and we need to see if the outcome of Step 3 affects any subsequent steps after Step 5.

Looking at the route steps:

1. Drive east.
2. Turn left onto South Hughes Road.
3. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto State Highway 37/MN 37.
4. Turn left to take the US 53 ramp.
5. Take the MN 37 East exit on the right toward Gilbert/Biwabik.

So, Step 3 is when the driver gets onto State Highway 37. The question is whether this action (getting on SH 37) has any effect after Step 5.

After Step 5, the route continues with more turns and directions. For example, in Step 6: Turn right onto State Highway 37 again. So, even though they were already on SH 37 at Step 3, they might be getting off or continuing on it later.

Wait, but in this case, after Step 5, the driver is taking the MN 37 East exit. But then, in Step 6, they turn right onto SH 37 again. That suggests that SH 37 is being used again after Step 3, meaning the action from Step 3 (entering SH 37) affects the future steps like Step 6.

So, yes, the effect of getting on SH 37 at Step 3 is used again in Step 6 when they turn onto SH 37 again. Therefore, it's still active or live after Step 5.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 9, the driver getting on North Meacham Road, live at any point after Step 9?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 9 in the travel route is ""live"" at any point after that step. Let me start by understanding what each step says.

Step 9 is where the driver turns right onto North Meacham Road and continues for a certain distance before arriving at their destination. So, the action here is getting on North Meacham Road.

Now, I need to check if this action (getting on that road) has any future effect after Step 9. That means I should look ahead in the route steps beyond Step 9 to see if there's any reference or use of North Meacham Road again.

Looking at the route steps after Step 9: The next step is arriving at the destination. There are no other steps mentioned, so it seems like once they get on North Meacham Road, they continue until arrival without any further actions or references to that road.

Since there's no mention of using North Meacham Road again in the future after Step 9, the effect from Step 9 isn't used again. Therefore, this variable is not live because its value isn't reused later on.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the variable from Step 13 is used again after Step 17 in the given travel route. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, let's list out all the steps and see what happens at each point. The goal is to identify when a specific action or turn (from Step 13) might be used again later, which would mean it's live.

Step 13: The driver takes the US 9 South ramp on the right. So, they're getting onto US 9 here.

Now, I need to check each step after that to see if US 9 is used again.

Looking at Step 14: Take the US 9 exit on the right toward Tarrytown. So, they exit US 9 here, moving away from it.

Step 15: Bear right onto North Highland Avenue/US 9. Here, they turn right and get back onto US 9. That's after exiting in Step 14, so this is a reuse of US 9. This would mean that the action from Step 13 (getting on US 9) affects Step 15 where they are using it again.

But wait, the question is specifically about whether the effect from Step 13 is live at any point after Step 17. So I need to check up until Step 17.

Step 16: Turn right onto Broadway/US 9. Again, they're turning onto US 9 here. So that's another reuse of the same route.

Step 17: Turn left onto Hudson Street. They leave US 9 here and turn onto Hudson Street.

So, after Step 13, they use US 9 again at Steps 15 and 16 before leaving it in Step 17. Therefore, the effect from Step 13 is definitely used again later.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 11 is live after Step 14 in the given travel route. Let me start by understanding what each step entails and then see how they connect.

Step 11 says ""Turn right onto GA 5/GA 120/South Marietta Parkway. Continue on GA 5."" So, at this point, the driver is getting on GA 5 and continuing on it. Now, I need to check if after Step 14, there's any use of GA 5 again that might depend on the value set in Step 11.

Looking at Step 14: ""Bear right onto Roberts Boulevard Northwest."" So, they're turning right onto a new road here. I'm trying to see if any variables related to GA 5 are being used beyond this point. 

The next steps after 14 don't mention GA 5 again. They go into various streets like Barrett Park Drive and eventually the destination is on the right. Since there's no further reference to GA 5, it seems that once they turned off onto Roberts Boulevard, they aren't using GA 5 anymore. Therefore, the effect of Step 11 isn't being used after Step 14.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 12, the driver getting on King Street, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect of Step 12 is live after Step 15 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding what a ""live variable"" means here. It's about whether a value (like being on King Street) will be used again before it's discarded or overwritten. So, I need to track when the driver is on King Street and see if that state occurs again after Step 15.

Looking at the steps provided:

Step 12: Turn left onto King Street/MA 2A/MA 110.
So at this point, the driver enters King Street.

Now, going through the subsequent steps up to Step 15:

Step 13: Turn left to stay on King Street.
This means the driver is still on King Street, so the state remains active.

Step 14: Turn right onto Harvard Road.
Here, the driver turns off King Street and moves onto Harvard Road. So, from Step 14 onwards, the state of being on King Street should no longer be relevant unless it's revisited later.

Now, the question is whether this effect (being on King Street) is live after Step 15. That would mean, does the driver return to King Street again after Step 15?

Looking further ahead, but since the provided steps only go up to Step 29 and don't mention returning to King Street after Step 14, I need to check if there's any indication of that.

Wait, maybe I should check all the steps beyond Step 15. Let me list them out:

Step 16: Turn left onto Fairbanks Street.
Step 17: Turn right onto Old Littleton Road.
Step 18: Turn right onto Center Bridge Road.
Step 19: Turn left onto Bolton Road.
Step 20: Keep left to stay on Bolton Road.
Step 21: Turn left onto South Main Street/MA 70.
Step 22: Bear right onto Sterling Road.
Step 23: Turn left onto Parker Road.
Step 24: Turn left after 1819 meters or 119-145 seconds.
Step 25: Bear left after 123 meters or 18-22 seconds.
Step 26: Turn left after 27 meters or 4 seconds.
Step 27: Turn right after 34 meters or 5-6 seconds.
Step 28: Continue for 126 meters or 22-26 seconds.
Step 29: Destination is on the right.

I don't see any steps beyond Step 14 where the driver turns back onto King Street. So, from Step 15 onwards, the driver has already left King Street and doesn't return to it again in these steps.

Therefore, after Step 15, the effect of being on King Street (Step 12) isn't used again. So, the answer should be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on US 6, live at any point after Step 7?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action in Step 6, where the driver gets on US 6, is ""live"" at any point after Step 7. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's look at what each step entails. Step 6 is when the driver turns right onto Clifton Boulevard/US 6/US 20/SR 2 and continues on US 6. So, they're getting onto US 6 here. Then, in Step 7, they take the US 6 East/US 20 East exit toward West 25th Street. That means they're continuing on US 6 towards that exit.

The question is whether the effect of getting onto US 6 in Step 6 is live after Step 7. A live variable, according to the benchmark, is one whose value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I need to see if the fact that they're on US 6 at Step 6 is used again later.

Looking ahead from Step 6, they continue on US 6 through several steps: after exiting onto West 25th Street (Step 7), they turn right again onto West 25th Street/US 6/US 20 (Step 8). So here, the driver is still on US 6. Then in Step 9, they turn left onto Detroit Avenue/US 6/US 20/US 42/SR 3 and continue on US 6 again. This continues through multiple steps until Step 11, where they turn right onto Superior Avenue/US 6/US 322 and keep going on US 6.

So, the driver remains on US 6 for a significant number of steps after Step 6. That means the fact that they got on US 6 in Step 6 is definitely used again after Step 7. They're continuing on that same road, so the value from Step 6 (being on US 6) is still relevant and used multiple times in subsequent steps.

I don't see any point where this information is discarded or overwritten before it's used again. Therefore, based on the benchmark definition of a live variable, the effect from Step 6 is indeed live at points after Step 7.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 19, the driver getting on AL 79, live at any point after Step 21?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 19 is still ""live"" after Step 21 in the given travel route. Let me break it down.

First, understanding what a ""live variable"" means here. From the definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, each step involves a turn or direction change, so I'm guessing these are like instructions that the driver follows sequentially.

Looking at Step 19: The driver gets on AL 79 after taking the exit on the right. So, they're entering AL 79 here. Then, in Step 21, it mentions keeping left to stay on Memorial Parkway Southwest. That means the driver is still on Memorial Parkway, which might be a different road from AL 79.

Now, I need to see if after Step 21, the driver will use AL 79 again or if they've already left it for good. Since Step 21 mentions staying on Memorial Parkway Southwest, it's possible that the driver has moved away from AL 79 at this point. But I should check later steps to see if they return to AL 79.

Looking ahead, after Step 21, there are more steps like keeping right onto Whitesburg Drive South and continuing for a certain distance. There's no mention of returning to AL 79 in the subsequent steps provided. The last step says the destination is on the right, but it doesn't specify any return to AL 79.

So, the effect from Step 19 (getting onto AL 79) happens at that point, and unless it's used again later, it won't be live anymore. Since there's no indication in the given steps after Step 21 that they go back to AL 79, I think the effect isn't used again.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on Airport Road, live at any point after Step 11?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 11 is ""live"" in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what a ""live variable"" is according to the given definition. A variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, I need to determine if any use of Step 11 happens after that point.

Looking at the route steps provided:

1. Drive west on Ward Avenue Northeast.
2. Turn left onto Andrew Jackson Way Northeast.
3. Bear left onto Andrew Jackson Way.
4. Turn left onto US 431/Governors Drive Southeast. Continue on US 431.
5. Turn right onto US 278/US 431/5th Avenue Northwest. Continue on US 431.
6. Turn right onto Bynum Leatherwood Road/CR 109.
7. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto Bynum Leatherwood Road/CR 109.
8. Turn right onto Albert P Brewer Highway/AL 202. Continue on AL 202.
9. Turn left onto US 78.
10. Turn right onto Caffey Drive.
11. Turn left onto Airport Road.
12. Continue for 896 meters or 53-64 seconds.
13. Destination is on the right.

Now, Step 11 is turning left onto Airport Road. I need to check if this step's effect (the driver being on Airport Road) is used again after Step 11.

Looking at Steps 12 and onwards: Step 12 says ""Continue for 896 meters or 53-64 seconds."" So the driver continues on Airport Road beyond Step 11. Then, the destination is on the right in Step 13. 

So, the action of being on Airport Road after Step 11 continues until reaching the destination. Therefore, the effect from Step 11 (being on Airport Road) is used again immediately in Step 12 and later in Step 13.

Thus, the variable (action) at Step 11 is indeed used again after that point.

Given the following travel planning scenario:

  Goal: MIDDLESEX HOSPITAL (MIDDLETOWN, CT) to First Church of Christ (Farmington, CT)

  Route steps:
['Drive northwest.', 'Turn right after 23 meters or 8-9 seconds.', 'Turn right onto Crescent Street.', 'Turn right onto Main Street Extension.', 'Turn left onto CT 17 North.', 'Keep left to take CT 9 North toward Portland/New Britain.', 'Keep left to stay on CT 9 North.', 'Keep right to stay on CT 9 North.', 'Keep left to take exit 40A onto I 84 West toward CT 4/Waterbury.', 'Take exit 39 on the right onto CT 4 toward Farmington.', 'Keep left to take CT 4 West.', 'Continue for 8079 meters or 383-468 seconds.', 'Your destination is on the left.']

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on CT 9, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect of Step 6 is still active (i.e., ""live"") at any point after Step 8 in this travel route. Let me break down each step and see how they connect.

Step 6: The driver is instructed to get on CT 9 North toward Portland/New Britain. This action sets the current road as CT 9. So, when we're at Step 6, the variable representing CT 9's status (being on it) is live because it's used in future steps.

Moving to Step 8: Here, the driver needs to keep left to stay on CT 9 North. This step continues the action from Step 6 but doesn't change the current road. So, the effect of Step 6 is still relevant here because the driver remains on CT 9.

Now, after Step 8, I need to check if the effect of Step 6 is used again in any subsequent steps. Let's look at the steps beyond Step 8:

- Step 9: The driver takes exit 40A onto I 84 West toward CT 4/Waterbury. Here, they leave CT 9 and get on I 84.
- Step 10: Take exit 39 on the right onto CT 4 toward Farmington. Now, they're on CT 4.
- Step 11: Keep left to take CT 4 West. They continue on CT 4.
- Step 12: Continue for a certain distance. Still on CT 4.
- The destination is on the left in the end, but that's just the final step.

Looking at these, after Step 8, the driver leaves CT 9 and doesn't return to it again. So, the effect of being on CT 9 only happens until they exit onto I 84. Therefore, there are no steps beyond Step 8 where the driver is still on CT 9. 

But wait, in Step 8 itself, the driver is keeping left to stay on CT 9. So, the action from Step 6 (getting on CT 9) is used again at Step 8. Does that count? The question asks if the effect from Step 6 is live after Step 8. Since Step 8 is part of the same route plan, maybe it's considered as using the effect again before moving beyond.

However, typically, in data-flow analysis, a variable is live if its value affects any future steps after that point. Here, Step 6 sets CT 9 as the current road. Steps after that (like Step 8) might still use that information because the driver is still on CT 9. But once they exit onto another road (Step 9), the effect of being on CT 9 ceases.

But in this case, the question is specifically about whether the effect from Step 6 is live at any point after Step 8. So, any steps that come after Step 8—Steps 9 to the end—are not using CT 9 anymore. Therefore, the effect from Step 6 isn't used again after Step 8.

Wait, but Step 8 itself uses the fact that they are still on CT 9. So, maybe the variable is live at Step 8 because it's being used then. But the question is about any point after Step 8, meaning Steps 9 and beyond. Since they leave CT 9 at Step 9, there's no further use of CT 9 in their journey.

So, putting it all together: The effect from Step 6 (being on CT 9) is used again at Step 8, which is part of the same plan but before exiting CT 9. After Step 8, they're no longer on CT 9, so the variable isn't used again in Steps 9 onwards. Therefore, the effect from Step 6 isn't live after Step 8.

  Is the effect from Step 26, the driver getting on North 4th Street, live at any point after Step 26?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect of Step 26 is live after that step. Let me start by understanding what ""live variable analysis"" means in this context. From the benchmark definition, a variable is considered live if its value is used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded.

In the given scenario, we're dealing with a travel route planning problem where each step is an action taken by the driver. The question specifically asks about Step 26, which involves turning onto North 4th Street. I need to determine whether the action of getting on North 4th Street has any future use beyond Step 26.

Looking at the list of steps provided, after Step 26, the route continues with several turns and streets like Ellet Street, North 5th Street, Center Street, etc. So, I should check if any subsequent steps reference or utilize the fact that the driver is on North 4th Street.

Wait, but in the given steps, after Step 26 (""Turn right onto North 4th Street.""), the next step is ""Continue for 123 meters or 16-20 seconds."" Then it says, ""Your destination is on the left."" So, after turning onto North 4th Street, the driver continues straight and then turns again to reach the destination.

I need to see if the action of being on North 4th Street affects any future steps beyond Step 26. The next step mentions continuing on North 4th Street for a short distance before another turn is made. That suggests that the current street (North 4th) is still relevant as the driver moves forward, even though it's a continuation rather than a branching path.

So, the variable representing being on North 4th Street would be used again in the next step, meaning its effect is live after Step 26.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of getting on North Raquette River Road in step 2 is still relevant (i.e., ""live"") after step 3. Let me break it down.

First, what does it mean for an effect to be live? From the benchmark given, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being discarded or overwritten. In this context, each route step is like a variable that might influence future steps.

Looking at the scenario: the goal is to get from Massena to Plattsburgh. The route has several steps, and we're focusing on step 2 where the driver turns left onto North Raquette River Road. Then, in step 3, they turn again to stay on that same road, which might mean continuing on it but perhaps changing direction or something else.

Wait, no—step 3 says ""Turn left to stay on North Raquette River Road."" So after turning left at step 2, step 3 is a continuation of the same road. Then step 4 is a turn right onto NY 37/NY-37, which exits them from North Raquette River Road.

So in step 2, they get on North Raquette River Road. Step 3 continues on it, so it's still active. Then step 4 turns off, so the effect of being on that road is no longer relevant beyond step 4. So after step 3, when we're at step 4, they've already turned onto another road.

Wait, but the question is whether the effect from step 2 is live after step 3. Since in step 3 they're still on North Raquette River Road, it's still active. But does that mean its effect is used again? Or does the fact that they're still on the same road count as using it again?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether after step 3, there's any further use of North Raquette River Road beyond just being on it in step 3. Since step 4 exits that road, perhaps after step 3, when they are still on it, the effect is live until step 4.

But wait, the question specifically asks if the effect from step 2 is live at any point after step 3. So up to step 4, they're using North Raquette River Road in step 3, so that's another use, making it live again.

So yes, because even though step 3 is a continuation, it's still an active use of the route from step 2.

Question:

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 18 is live at any point after that step. Let me break it down.

First, let's look at what each step does. The goal is to go from St. Augustine Hall in Kansas City to the Atchison Post Office. 

Looking at the steps provided, up until Step 18, which is ""Turn right onto Kansas Street."" After this, there are a few more steps: continue on Kansas Street for a bit, arrive at the destination.

The definition here is about live variables. A variable is live if its value is used again before being discarded. So, in this context, I'm assuming we're talking about whether the action or state of turning right onto Kansas Street (Step 18) is used again later on.

After Step 18, the driver continues on Kansas Street and eventually arrives at the destination. The last step mentions arriving, so that's the end point.

Now, does the act of turning right onto Kansas Street have any effect after Step 18? Well, yes, because the driver continues driving on Kansas Street. So, the action itself isn't repeated again as a separate turn, but it's part of the ongoing journey.

However, I'm not sure if the specific instruction to ""Turn right onto Kansas Street"" is used again or only once. Since after Step 18, the driver doesn't make another explicit turn onto Kansas Street; instead, they continue on it. So maybe the action itself isn't repeated as a command but is part of their path.

Wait, but the question is about whether the effect from Step 18 (turning right) is live. If turning onto Kansas Street leads them to continue on that street until arrival, does that mean the effect is ongoing? Or is the effect considered only if the same action is used again later.

I think in terms of data-flow analysis, if a variable (here, an instruction) affects future steps, it's live. So here, turning onto Kansas Street influences their path for the rest of the route. Therefore, even though it's not repeated as a separate step, its effect continues to be used until arrival.

So yes, the effect from Step 18 is live because it influences the subsequent movements on Kansas Street.

  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on US 9, live at any point after Step 15?

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 10 is live at any point after Step 15 in the given travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive southwest on King Street/NY 120.
2. Turn left onto South Greeley Avenue/NY 120. Continue on South Greeley Avenue.
3. Turn right onto Washington Avenue.
4. Turn right onto Manville Road/NY 117. Continue on NY 117.
5. Turn left onto Bedford Road/NY 448.
6. Keep right to take Sleepy Hollow Road.
7. Bear left to stay on Sleepy Hollow Road.
8. Bear right onto Webber Avenue.
9. Turn right onto Bedford Road/NY 448.
10. Bear left onto North Broadway/US 9. Continue on US 9.
11. Turn right onto Broadway/US 9. Continue on US 9.
12. Turn left onto Warburton Avenue/US 9/NY 9A. Continue on US 9/NY 9A.
13. Turn left onto Prospect Street/US 9/NY 9A.
14. Turn right onto South Broadway/US 9/NY 9A. Continue on US 9.
15. Bear right onto Broadway/US 9.
16. Turn left onto West 215th Street.
17. Turn right onto 10th Avenue.
18. Bear right onto Nagle Avenue.
19. Turn left onto West 204th Street.
20. Turn right onto 10th Avenue.
21. Take exit 20 on the right toward Park Avenue/East 132nd Street.
22. Turn left onto East 116th Street.
23. Turn right onto Lexington Avenue.
24. Turn left onto East 24th Street.
25. Turn right onto 3rd Avenue.
26. Turn right onto Great Jones Street.
27. Continue for 117 meters or 15-19 seconds.
28. Your destination is on the right.

Now, Step 10 is where the driver gets onto US 9. The question is whether this effect (being on US 9) is live after Step 15.

Looking at Step 15: Bear right onto Broadway/US 9. So at Step 15, they are still on US 9. Therefore, the effect from Step 10, getting on US 9, is definitely used again at Step 15 when they turn right onto Broadway/US 9. Since the value (being on US 9) is used again later in the route, it's considered live.

I don't see any steps after Step 15 that would overwrite or discard the fact that they were on US 9. They continue on US 9 until Step 15 and beyond. So yes, the effect from Step 10 remains active at least until Step 15.

  Is the effect from Step 17, the driver getting on Old Mountain Road, live at any point after Step 19?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 17 is live after Step 19 in this travel route scenario. Let me start by understanding what each step entails.

Step 17 says ""Bear right onto Old Mountain Road North."" So the driver turns right and gets on Old Mountain Road North. That's probably where they're going to be driving next.

Now, moving on to Step 19: ""Continue for 63 meters or 25-31 seconds."" This seems like a short distance ahead, just 63 meters, which is about 65 feet. So after turning onto Old Mountain Road North in Step 17, the driver continues straight for a bit until they reach Step 19.

The question is asking if the effect of Step 17 (getting on Old Mountain Road) is live at any point after Step 19. A ""live"" variable, according to the benchmark, means that the value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded.

So, in this context, I need to see whether the action taken in Step 17 has an effect beyond Step 19. Since Step 17 is turning onto Old Mountain Road North and then continuing straight for a short distance in Step 19, it seems that after Step 19, they are still on Old Mountain Road North because they're just continuing straight.

Wait, but Step 20 says ""You have arrived at your destination."" So perhaps the route ends there. But I need to check if the effect of Step 17 is used again after Step 19.

Looking at the steps:

- Step 17: Turn right onto Old Mountain Road North.
- Steps 18 and 19: Continue straight on Old Mountain Road North for a short distance.
- Step 20: Arrive at destination.

So, after Step 19, they are still on Old Mountain Road North but have only traveled a bit further. The effect of turning onto Old Mountain Road in Step 17 is ongoing until the next turn or exit. Since there's no mention of exiting Old Mountain Road before arriving at the destination, it seems that the effect of Step 17 (being on Old Mountain Road) is still active through Step 19 and continues until arrival.

Therefore, yes, the effect from Step 17 is live after Step 19 because the driver remains on Old Mountain Road North until the end.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on State Highway 37, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 3, where the driver gets onto State Highway 37, is still ""live"" at any point after Step 8 in the given travel route.

First, I need to understand what a ""live variable"" is. From the definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, each step of the route is like an instruction that might set some state (like being on a particular highway). The question is about whether the effect from Step 3 (entering State Highway 37) affects any future steps after Step 8.

Let me break down the route steps provided:

1. Drive east.
2. Turn left onto South Hughes Road.
3. Turn right onto State Highway 37/MN 37.
4. Enter roundabout and take 2nd exit onto SH 37.
5. Turn right to take US 53 ramp.
6. Turn left onto Miller Trunk Rd/CH 132.
7. Turn left after certain meters/seconds.
8. Turn right to take US 53 ramp.

The question is about Step 3's effect being live after Step 8, so I need to see if the state created in Step 3 (being on SH 37) affects any step beyond Step 8.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 8:

9. Take MN 37 East exit on the right toward Gilbert/Biwabik.
10. Turn right onto State Highway 37/MN 37. Continue on MN 37.
11. Turn right onto State Highway 135/MN 135.
12. Turn right onto Main St North/CR 100/FH 11.
13. Turn left onto Highway 110/CH 110/FH 11.
14. Turn left after 658 meters or 37-46 seconds.
15. Continue for 107 meters or 16-19 seconds.
16. Destination is on the left.

From Step 9 onwards, it seems that at Step 10, there's a turn right onto State Highway 37 again. So, in Step 3, they entered SH 37, then later in Step 4, they take the 2nd exit to continue on SH 37. Then at Step 8, they turn right to take the US 53 ramp, which takes them off of SH 37.

Then, at Step 9, they're taking the MN 37 East exit towards Gilbert/Biwabik. After that, at Step 10, they turn right onto State Highway 37 again. So, the effect from Step 3 is being used again in Step 10.

Wait, but after Step 8, they take US 53 ramp, which would mean leaving SH 37. Then, in Step 9, they're taking an exit on MN 37 East, which is a different highway. However, at Step 10, they turn right onto State Highway 37 again.

So, the effect of being on SH 37 is used again after Step 8 (specifically at Step 10). Therefore, the variable (state) created in Step 3 is still live because it's used again later.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 4, the driver getting on Tremont Street, live at any point after Step 6?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 4 is still ""live"" after Step 6 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what each step is saying. The goal is for Nell to get from her home in Boston to the High Point Treatment Center in Middleborough, MA. The route involves a series of turns and street changes as they drive through different parts of Boston towards their destination.

Now, looking at Step 4: it says ""Bear right onto Tremont Street."" So the driver is turning onto Tremont Street here. Now, I need to check if this action has any future effect after Step 6.

Step 6 is where the driver turns left onto Melnea Cass Boulevard/MA 28. After that, they continue on MA 28 for several steps, including going through various streets like Plain Street and Main Street before reaching their destination.

The key here is to determine if the action taken at Step 4 (getting onto Tremont Street) has any impact after Step 6. Since the driver is moving from Tremont Street in Step 4, but then continues on MA 28 after multiple turns, it's possible that the effect of being on Tremont Street might not directly influence later steps because they're following a different route.

Wait, but the driver does pass through Tremont Street again at some point. Let me check the steps again. After Step 6, there are several turns keeping them on MA 28 until eventually turning onto Central Square and then Bedford Street. Then, after that, they turn left onto Old Center Street and Center Street before continuing to their destination.

Hmm, so Tremont Street is only mentioned in Steps 4 and later as a continuation of MA 28 at Step 9: ""Turn right onto Tremont Street/MA 28. Continue on MA 28."" So after leaving Tremont Street initially in Step 4, they return to it again much later.

But the question is whether the effect from Step 4 (being on Tremont Street) is live after Step 6. An effect is considered live if its value will be used again in the future before being discarded or overwritten.

In this case, the driver does use Tremont Street again after Step 6 when they turn right onto it at Step 9 and continue on MA 28. So the action from Step 4, getting onto Tremont Street, is indeed used again later on, specifically at Step 9. Therefore, the effect from Step 4 is still live after Step 6 because the driver returns to Tremont Street after that step.

So, putting it all together: The driver starts on Tremont Street in Step 4, leaves it, and then comes back to it again after Step 6 at Step 9. Therefore, the effect from Step 4 is still present or used again later, making it live.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 26, the driver getting on North Dennis Avenue, live at any point after Step 26?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the variable from Step 26 is live after that step. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what ""live"" means in this context. From the benchmark given, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I should look for any steps where North Dennis Avenue's value might be needed again after Step 26.

Looking at the route steps provided, after Step 26, which is ""Turn left onto North Dennis Avenue,"" the next step says to continue for 156 meters or about 16-20 seconds. Then, the destination is mentioned as being on the right. 

I'm wondering if there's any further use of North Dennis Avenue beyond Step 26. After turning onto North Dennis Avenue, it seems like that's the road you're continuing on until the next steps. The route continues with specific directions and eventually ends at Bishopville.

I don't see any other steps after Step 26 where North Dennis Avenue is mentioned again. It's only used once to turn left and then continued for a bit before turning again onto Chestnut Ferry Road. So, after that point, the variable isn't referenced again, which suggests it might not be needed further down the route.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. The variable is the road name, so if any of the subsequent steps refer back to North Dennis Avenue, that would make it live. But in this list, I don't see any reference after Step 26 except for continuing on it and then turning off. So, once you leave North Dennis Avenue at Step 27 by turning onto Chestnut Ferry Road, there's no further use of North Dennis Avenue.

Therefore, after Step 26, the variable isn't used again. It's only referenced in Step 26 and Step 27, where you're already on it before moving past it. So, after Step 26, when the driver is on North Dennis Avenue, that's the last time it's mentioned. There's no future use of this variable beyond turning off it.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action taken in Step 4 affects anything that happens after Step 7 in this travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand each step of the route:

Step 1: Drive north on South 2nd Street.
Step 2: Turn left onto Olive Street/IA 2. Continue on IA 2.
Step 3: Bear left onto State Highway 2/IA 2. Continue on IA 2.
Step 4: Turn right onto US 63/Smith Street. Continue on US 63.
Step 5: Take the US 63 exit on the right.
Step 6: Turn right to take the IA 163 ramp.
Step 7: Take exit 40 on the right onto CR G28 toward Pella/Lake Red Rock.

The question is whether the effect from Step 4, which is getting on US 63, is still live (i.e., used again) after Step 7. 

So, in Step 4, the driver turns right onto US 63 and continues on it. Then in Step 5, they take an exit to get off of US 63. After that, in Step 6, they turn right onto IA 163. Step 7 takes them onto CR G28.

Wait a minute, after leaving US 63 at Step 5, they don't go back on it again. They take the exit and move to IA 163 then CR G28. So the only time they're on US 63 is from Step 4 to Step 5. After that, they leave US 63 for good.

But wait, in Step 7, they are taking exit 40 onto CR G28 towards Pella. Pella is where Scholte's house is located. So, the destination is after CR G28. Now, I'm trying to see if there's any point after Step 7 where US 63 would be used again.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 7, there are no more mentions of US 63. The route continues until they reach their destination on Washington Street/IA 163 Bus after 2570 meters or about 145-178 seconds. So, after Step 7, they're on CR G28 and then turn left onto IA 163 Bus.

Therefore, the only time they are on US 63 is in Steps 4 and 5. After that, they leave US 63 and don't return to it again in the given route steps. The destination is on IA 163 Bus, which is a different road.

So, the effect from Step 4, being on US 63, doesn't occur again after Step 7 because they've already exited US 63 by Step 5. Therefore, the action in Step 4 isn't used again later.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 3, where the driver gets onto MA 1A, is still being used (or is live) after Step 8 in the given travel route. 

First, let me break down what each step entails.

Step 3: Turn right onto MA 1A/Cabot Street. So at this point, the driver is entering MA 1A. Now, I need to see if this action has any impact on later steps, specifically after Step 8.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 8 is ""Keep left to stay on MA 138."" Wait, but earlier in Step 3, the driver was on MA 1A. So how does that transition happen? Let me check the steps again.

After Step 5: Take the MA 128 South ramp on the right toward Peabody/Boston.
Step 6: Keep left to take exit 26 onto I 93 North/US 1 toward Boston.
Step 7: Take exit 2A on the right onto MA 138 South toward Stoughton.
Step 8: Keep left to stay on MA 138.

Wait, so after exiting onto MA 138 in Step 7, the driver keeps left to stay on MA 138. So at this point, they're still on MA 138. But earlier, in Step 3, they were on MA 1A/Cabot Street.

I'm trying to see if there's any use of MA 1A after Step 8. Let me check the subsequent steps:

Step 9: Turn left onto Washington Street/MA 138.
Step 10: Keep right to stay on Washington Street.
Step 11: Enter Taunton Green and take the 2nd exit onto US 44/MA 140/Taunton Green.
Step 12: Bear right onto Summer Street/MA 140. Continue on MA 140.
Step 13: Take exit 4 on the right toward Mount Pleasant Street/Airport Road.
Step 14: Turn left onto Mount Pleasant Street.
Step 15: Turn right onto Downey Street.
Steps 16-17: Continue for some meters, then arrive at destination.

So after Step 8, the driver is on MA 138. The steps following don't mention MA 1A again. So it seems that after Step 3, the driver leaves MA 1A and doesn't return to it by Step 8. Therefore, the effect of being on MA 1A in Step 3 isn't used again after Step 8.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the steps after Step 8 are on MA 138, which is a different route. So the driver leaves MA 1A and moves to MA 138. Therefore, there's no further use of MA 1A beyond Step 3, so by Step 8, they're already off MA 1A.

So the effect from Step 3 isn't live after Step 8 because the driver has already left that route.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on US 27, live at any point after Step 7?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect of the driver getting onto US 27 in step 6 is still active (or ""live"") at any point after step 7. Let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

First, looking at the steps provided:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn left after 58 meters or 8-9 seconds.
3. Turn right after 19 meters or 4-5 seconds.
4. Turn left onto Millersburg Pike/KY 32/KY 36 and continue.
5. Turn right onto North Main Street/KY 36/US 27 Business and continue.
6. Turn left onto US 27/US 62.
7. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit toward US 27 South/Paris.
8. Bear right onto US 27/US 68/Paris By-Pass Road.
9. Make a left U-turn to stay on US 68.
10. Turn right onto Linville Drive.
11. Turn left after 181 meters or 20-25 seconds.
12. Continue for 32 meters or 6-8 seconds.
13. Arrive at the destination.

Now, step 6 is where the driver turns left onto US 27/US 62. I'm assuming that this action makes them enter US 27, which they will continue to use as their route towards Paris. 

After step 6, they continue on US 27 until step 7, where they enter a roundabout and take the second exit toward US 27 South/Paris. So, they're still on US 27 after that.

Step 8 has them bear right onto US 27 again, so they're definitely continuing on US 27. Then in step 9, they make a left U-turn to stay on US 68, which might change their route, but step 10 turns right onto Linville Drive. Wait, does this mean they are no longer on US 27 after step 8? Let me double-check.

Wait, step 6: Turn left onto US 27/US 62. Then step 7: Enter roundabout and take 2nd exit toward US 27 South/Paris. So in the roundabout, they take an exit that's still on US 27 towards Paris. Then step 8: Bear right onto US 27/US 68/Paris By-Pass Road. Hmm, so now they're on a road that includes US 27 and US 68, but I'm not sure if this is the same as before or a different segment.

But regardless of whether it's the same physical road or a different named portion, they are still on US 27 after step 8 because the bear right leads them onto US 27 again. So their current route is on US 27, and in step 9, they make a left U-turn to stay on US 68, which might be a detour but doesn't affect the fact that they were on US 27 up until step 8.

After step 10, they turn right onto Linville Drive. Now, I'm not sure if this is part of US 27 or another route. If Linville Drive is a different road, then after step 10, they're no longer on US 27.

But the question is whether the effect from step 6 (getting on US 27) is live at any point after step 7. So, after step 7, which is still on US 27, and before step 8, when they bear right onto US 27 again, their current route is definitely using US 27.

So, the effect of being on US 27 in step 6 would have been used in steps 7 and 8. Therefore, after step 7, at step 8, they are still on US 27, making that effect live.

Wait, but let me think again. Step 6 is when they enter US 27/US 62. Then, step 7: roundabout exit to US 27 South/Paris. So they're continuing on US 27 towards Paris. Step 8: bear right onto US 27 again. So they are still on US 27 after step 8.

Therefore, after step 7, in steps 8 and beyond, they are still using the effect of being on US 27 from step 6.

So yes, the effect is live at points after step 7.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 7 is live at any point after that step. The scenario is about a travel route from Manchester-Boston Regional Airport to St. John's Church in Portsmouth, NH.

First, let me break down what each step does:

Step 1: Drive south.
Step 2: Turn left after 1311 meters or 170-208 seconds.
Step 3: Turn right onto Airport Road.
Step 4: Keep right on Airport Road.
Step 5: Another turn right to stay on Airport Road.
Step 6: Turn right to take the I 293 South ramp.
Step 7: Keep left to stay on NH 101 toward Concord/Portsmouth.

So, after Step 7, the driver is on NH 101 heading towards Portsmouth. The question is whether any of the values from Step 7 are used again later. Since the definition says a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded, I need to check each step after Step 7 to see if they reference anything related to NH 101.

Looking ahead:

Step 8: Keep right to take exit 7 onto NH 101 toward Portsmouth.
Wait, so here at Step 8, the driver takes another action on NH 101. That might mean that the value from Step 7 (being on NH 101) is used again in Step 8.

But let me check further steps:

Step 9: Take exit 12 on the right onto I 95 toward Portsmouth.
This seems like a new road, so probably not using NH 101 anymore after this point.

Wait, but Step 8 is still on NH 101, and then in Step 9 they leave to take I 95. So perhaps the value from Step 7 (NH 101) is used again at Step 8 when taking exit 7.

So yes, because Step 8 uses the fact that they were on NH 101 after Step 7.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 21, the driver getting on South Indiana Avenue, live at any point after Step 21?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the variable ""South Indiana Avenue"" is a live variable after step 21 in the given travel route. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

Live variables are those whose values are used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, if ""South Indiana Avenue"" is mentioned again later in the steps after step 21, then it's live. Otherwise, if it only appears once and isn't referenced again, it might not be considered live.

Looking at the route steps provided, I'll need to go through each step beyond step 21 to see if South Indiana Avenue is mentioned again.

The given steps are from 0 to 22 (assuming step 21 is the one where they get onto South Indiana Avenue). So, starting from step 22 onwards:

Step 21: Turn left onto South Indiana Avenue.
Step 22: Continue for 1124 meters or 113-138 seconds.
Step 23: Your destination is on the right.

Wait, let me check if I miscounted. The list provided is a list of steps starting with 'Drive east.' up to 'Take the exit...'. So, step numbers are from 0 upwards. Let me recount:

0. Drive east.
1. Turn right onto Ridge Avenue.
2. Turn left onto Central Street.
3. Turn right onto Sheridan Road.
4. Turn left to stay on Sheridan Road.
5. Bear right onto Forest Place.
6. Bear left onto Forest Avenue.
7. Turn left onto Hamilton Street.
8. Turn right onto Sheridan Road.
9. Turn left to stay on Sheridan Road.
10. Turn left to stay on Sheridan Road.
11. Bear right onto North Sheridan Road.
12. Bear left onto West Sheridan Road.
13. Turn left onto North Jean Baptiste Point DuSable Lake Shore Drive.
14. Take the exit on the right toward Grand Avenue/Illinois Street/Navy Pier/Wacker Drive.
15. Turn right onto East Grand Avenue.
16. Turn left onto North Lower Michigan Avenue.
17. Turn left onto East Lower Wacker Drive.
18. Take the exit on the right toward Lake Shore Drive South/US 41 South.
19. Turn right onto East Roosevelt Road.
20. Turn left onto South Indiana Avenue.
21. Continue for 1124 meters or 113-138 seconds.
22. Your destination is on the right.

Wait, that doesn't add up because step 20 would be turning onto South Indiana Avenue, and then step 21 is the continue instruction. So actually, in the initial list provided by the user, the steps are numbered from 0 to 13 (maybe), but perhaps they intended step numbers as 1-22.

Wait, no, the user's route steps are listed as a list with elements from index 0 to 21, making it 22 steps. So step 20 is ""Turn left onto South Indiana Avenue."" Then step 21 is ""Continue for..."" and step 22 is ""Your destination..."".

So in that case, after step 21, the only mention of South Indiana Avenue is at step 20, which is before step 21. But then, does it appear again? Let me check beyond step 21:

After step 21 (continue) and step 22 (destination), there are no more steps listed. So South Indiana Avenue is used in step 20 and nowhere else.

Therefore, after step 21, the value of ""South Indiana Avenue"" isn't used again. So it's not a live variable anymore because its value isn't referenced or needed after that point.

  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on MA 2, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the variable from Step 10 is used again after Step 15 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps for clarity:

1. Drive northeast on Tower Street.
2. Turn left onto Highland Avenue.
3. Bear left to stay on Highland Avenue.
4. Turn right onto Massachusetts Avenue/MA 2A. Continue on Massachusetts Avenue.
5. Make a sharp left to stay on Massachusetts Avenue.
6. Turn right onto US 3/MA 16/Alewife Brook Parkway.
7. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto US 3/MA 2/MA 16/Concord Avenue.
8. Enter Sozio Rotary and take the 2nd exit onto US 3/MA 2/MA 16/Concord Avenue.
9. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto US 3/MA 2/MA 16/Alewife Brook Parkway.
10. Keep left to stay on MA 2.
11. Keep left to stay on MA 2.
12. Enter Concord Rotary and take the 2nd exit onto MA 2/MA 111 North/Union Turnpike.
13. Keep left to take MA 2/Concord Turnpike.
14. Take exit 99A on the right onto MA 12 South toward Leominster.
15. Turn right onto Hospital Road.
16. Turn left after 243 meters or 44-54 seconds.
17. Continue for 52 meters or 14-17 seconds.
18. Your destination is on the left.

Now, focusing on Step 10: ""Keep left to stay on MA 2."" So, at this point, the driver gets onto MA 2 again. The question is whether this variable (MA 2) is used after Step 15.

Looking at Steps 16 through 18: After turning right onto Hospital Road and making a left turn, then continuing for some distance, the destination is on the left. Now, I need to check if MA 2 is mentioned again after Step 15. 

From Step 12 onwards, MA 2 is used a couple of times, but that's before Step 15. Then at Step 14, exit 99A leads onto MA 12 South, and from there on, the route goes towards Leominster via Hospital Road, etc.

So, after Step 15, which is turning right onto Hospital Road, there's no mention of MA 2 being used again. The remaining steps involve turns onto Hospital Road and then the final destination. So MA 2 isn't referenced beyond Step 14.

Therefore, the effect from Step 10 (getting on MA 2) doesn't occur again after Step 15.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 17, the driver getting on Air Museum Drive, live at any point after Step 17?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 17 in this travel route is ""live"" at any point after Step 17. Let me break it down.

First, what's a live variable? From the definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So I need to see if something from Step 17 is used later in the route.

Looking at the steps, Step 17 says the driver gets on Air Museum Drive. The next step after that is Step 18: ""Continue for 116 meters or 44-54 seconds."" Then it says they've arrived at their destination.

I'm not sure what variables are involved here. Maybe ""Air Museum Drive"" is a location variable, but I don't see any other steps mentioning using this drive again. After Step 17, the driver just continues on Air Museum Drive and then arrives. There's no further use of that specific action or direction after arriving.

So, does getting on Air Museum Drive in Step 17 get used again later? It doesn't seem like it. The only use is moving forward from Step 17 to arrival at the destination. Since there's no subsequent step where they turn left or right again or take another exit related to Air Museum Drive after that point, I think the effect of Step 17 isn't used again.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the variable ""Long Beach Boulevard"" is live after Step 36 in this travel route scenario. First, I need to understand what a live variable means here. From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded.

Looking at the given steps, Step 36 is where the driver turns right onto Long Beach Boulevard/US 6 and continues on it for 253 meters. The question is asking if this step affects any subsequent use of Long Beach Boulevard after that point.

I'll go through each step one by one to see if ""Long Beach Boulevard"" is used again after Step 36. 

Step 37: Turn right onto East 1st Street. No mention of Long Beach Boulevard here, so it's not being used again yet.

Step 38: Turn right onto Long Beach Boulevard/US 6. Wait, this is Step 38, which is after Step 36. So at Step 38, the driver is turning onto Long Beach Boulevard again. That means the variable ""Long Beach Boulevard"" is being referenced once more after Step 36.

So, since the value of ""Long Beach Boulevard"" is used in Step 38, it's definitely being used again before being discarded. Therefore, this makes the variable live at that point.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 2 is a live variable after that step. Let me break it down.

The scenario is about driving from Parkman, Francis, House in Boston to Lawrence Municipal Airport (LAWRENCE, MA). The route steps are given as a list of instructions from Step 1 to Step 15.

Step 2 says the driver gets on MA 28. I need to check if this action affects any future steps where MA 28 is used again. 

Looking at the route steps after Step 2: 

- Steps 3,4,5,6,7 all mention MA 28 or related streets like MA 133 East and MA 125. So, in each of these steps, the driver remains on MA 28 until turning onto other roads.

After Step 15, the destination is reached, so no more steps after that. 

Since MA 28 is used multiple times after Step 2 (Steps 3-7), its effect is still relevant and used again before it's no longer needed. Therefore, the variable from Step 2 (getting on MA 28) is live at points after Step 2.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect of Step 8 is still being used (or ""live"") after Step 11 in the given travel route. Let's break this down.

First, let's list all the steps for clarity:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn left after 44 meters or 7-9 seconds.
3. Turn left onto Webster Street.
4. Turn right onto Summer Street.
5. Turn left onto Main Street/MA 97/MA 125.
6. Turn right onto Route 125 Connector.
7. Take the I 495 South ramp on the right toward Lawrence.
8. Take exit 97A on the right onto I 93 South toward Boston.
9. Keep left to take I 93 South/Interstate 93 HOV lane.
10. Keep left to stay on I 93 South/Interstate 93 HOV lane.
11. Keep right to take I 93 South/US 1 toward I 95/Providence Rhode Island.
12. Take exit 4 onto MA 24 South toward Fall River.
13. Take exit 17A on the right onto MA 140 South toward New Bedford.
14. Take exit 4 on the right toward Mount Pleasant Street/Airport Road.
15. Turn left onto Mount Pleasant Street.
16. Turn right onto Downey Street.
17. Turn right after 1330 meters or 95-116 seconds.
18. Continue for 59 meters or 12-15 seconds.
19. Arrive at destination.

Step 8 is where the driver gets on I 93 South. The question is whether this action (getting on I 93) has an effect that's still being used after Step 11.

Looking at Steps 9 to 11, it seems like the driver is continuing on I 93 South. So, the initial decision to take exit 97A onto I 93 in Step 8 must have been made when entering the highway. Then, in Steps 9-10, they're keeping left to stay on I 93 South, and in Step 11, they keep right to continue on I 93 South towards I 95.

So, the effect of Step 8 (entering I 93) is being used throughout Steps 9-11. That means after Step 11, the driver is still on I 93, so the effect from Step 8 is indeed live.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action from Step 6 is live at any point after Step 9 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive west.
2. Turn left onto Forest Street.
3. Bear right after 295 meters or 31-37 seconds.
4. Bear right onto Capitol Avenue.
5. Turn right onto Sisson Avenue.
6. Turn right to take the I 84 ramp.
7. Keep right to take I 84 West toward Waterbury.
8. Keep left to stay on I 84 West/Yankee Expressway.
9. Take exit 18 on the right toward Highland Avenue.
10. Keep right toward Highland Avenue.
11. Turn left onto Highland Avenue.
12. Turn left onto West Main Street.
13. Continue for 95 meters or 7-9 seconds.
14. Arrive at destination.

The question is about Step 6, which is taking the I 84 ramp. We need to check if this action has any effect (i.e., being used again) after Step 9.

Step 6 involves turning right onto the I 84 ramp. Now, let's see what happens after that. Steps 7 and 8 mention staying on I 84 West. So, after taking the ramp in Step 6, they are indeed continuing on I 84 West through steps 7 and 8.

Now, looking at Step 9: Take exit 18 toward Highland Avenue. After exiting, the driver continues on Highland Avenue (Step 10), then turns left onto Highland Avenue again (Step 11). Then another left to West Main Street (Step 12), which leads to continuing for a short distance before arriving.

So, after Step 6, the driver is on I 84 West. They continue this until they take exit 18 at Step 9. After exiting, they are off of I 84 West. Therefore, the action from Step 6 (getting onto I 84) affects their path through Steps 7 and 8 because they're still on that highway.

But does the effect from Step 6 (the initial taking of the I 84 ramp) have any live usage after Step 9? Well, once they exit at Step 9, they are no longer on I 84. So, after Step 9, their route is on Highland Avenue and West Main Street, not on I 84 anymore.

Wait, but does taking the I 84 ramp in Step 6 have any further effect beyond that? The initial action of getting on I 84 is done by Step 6. Then they keep right (Step 7) and keep left (Step 8) to stay on I 84 West. So up until Step 9, their position is affected by being on I 84.

After exiting at Step 9, the route changes direction. So any further steps after Step 9 don't involve I 84 anymore. Therefore, the effect of being on I 84 (from Step 6) doesn't influence the driver's path beyond Step 9 because they've already exited off the highway by then.

But wait, is the action itself considered live? Or is it that the variable representing their current location on I 84 is still relevant until they exit. The definition says a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, as long as there's any use of that information after the point in question, it counts.

In this case, the driver uses the fact that they are on I 84 from Step 6 until they exit at Step 9. So during Steps 7 and 8, they're using their position on I 84 to navigate (keeping right and left). Therefore, the effect of being on I 84 is indeed used again in Steps 7 and 8 after Step 6.

So yes, the action from Step 6 has an effect that's used again after Step 9.

  Is the effect from Step 15, the driver getting on Black Mountain Road, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 15 is live at any point after that step. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what each step in the route entails. The steps are a series of directions from Station KPH to Hofmann's house. Each step describes a turn or action taken by the driver.

Step 15 says: ""Turn left onto Black Mountain Road."" So at this point, the driver is turning onto Black Mountain Road. Now, I need to check if after Step 15, any previous variable (like the direction or location) affects anything else in the future steps. 

Looking ahead, after Step 15, the route continues with more turns on Black Mountain Road and then moves to Vista Road and La Cuesta Road. The last step mentions that the destination is on the right after a short drive.

I need to determine if the action taken at Step 15 (turning left onto Black Mountain Road) is used again in any future steps. From the list, after Step 15, the driver turns right onto Black Mountain Road again in Step 16 and then continues straight. That suggests that Black Mountain Road is being used more than once.

So, since the driver uses Black Mountain Road again after Step 15, the effect of getting on it at Step 15 is indeed used later. Therefore, the live variable analysis would indicate that yes, the effect from Step 15 is still active after that point.

  Is the effect from Step 8, the driver getting on I 96, live at any point after Step 10?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 8 is live after Step 10 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out the steps provided:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn right after 46 meters or 10-12 seconds.
3. Turn right after 28 meters or 11-13 seconds.
4. Turn left onto Temple Street.
5. Turn right onto John C Lodge Drive.
6. Take exit 4B onto I 94 West toward Chicago.
7. Take exit 213B on the right onto I 96 toward Lansing.
8. Keep right to take I 96 West toward Lansing.
9. Keep left to stay on I 96.
10. Continue on M 14 West.
11. Keep left to take exit 45 to stay on M 14 West toward Ann Arbor.
12. Take exit 3 on the right onto US 23 BUS toward Downtown Ann Arbor.
13. Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.
14. Turn left onto North Division Street.
15. Turn right onto East Ann Street.
16. Continue for 33 meters or 9-10 seconds.
17. Destination on the right.

Now, the question is about Step 8: getting on I 96 West toward Lansing. We need to see if this effect is live at any point after Step 10.

So, what does ""live"" mean here? From the benchmark definition, a variable (in this case, the action of being on I 96) is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, we need to check if after Step 10, there's any use of I 96 that refers back to Step 8.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 10:

Step 11: Keep left to stay on I 96.
Step 12: Take exit 3 onto US 23 BUS toward Downtown Ann Arbor.
Step 13: Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.
Step 14: Turn left onto North Division Street.
Step 15: Turn right onto East Ann Street.
Step 16: Continue for a bit.
Step 17: Destination on the right.

Wait, but after Step 10 (which is ""Continue on M 14 West.""), what happens? Let's recount:

After Step 10, we have:

11. Keep left to take exit 45 onto M 14 West toward Ann Arbor.
12. Take exit 3 onto US 23 BUS.
13. Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.
14. Turn left onto North Division Street.
15. Turn right onto East Ann Street.
16. Continue for 33 meters or 9-10 seconds.
17. Destination.

So, Step 11 says ""Keep left to stay on I 96."" Wait, no—Step 7 is taking exit 213B onto I 96 toward Lansing, and then Step 8 is Keep right to take I 96 West toward Lansing. Then Steps 9-10 are about staying on I 96.

So after Step 10, which is continuing on M 14 West, the route leaves I 96.

Looking at Step 11: ""Keep left to stay on I 96."" Wait, no—that's actually Step 7, right? Let me check again:

Wait, perhaps I misnumbered the steps. Let me recount from the original list provided:

The user listed 17 steps as:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn right after 46 meters or 10-12 seconds.
3. Turn right after 28 meters or 11-13 seconds.
4. Turn left onto Temple Street.
5. Turn right onto John C Lodge Drive.
6. Take exit 4B onto I 94 West toward Chicago.
7. Take exit 213B on the right onto I 96 toward Lansing.
8. Keep right to take I 96 West toward Lansing.
9. Keep left to stay on I 96.
10. Continue on M 14 West.
11. Keep left to take exit 45 to stay on M 14 West toward Ann Arbor.
12. Take exit 3 on the right onto US 23 BUS toward Downtown Ann Arbor.
13. Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.
14. Turn left onto North Division Street.
15. Turn right onto East Ann Street.
16. Continue for 33 meters or 9-10 seconds.
17. Your destination is on the right.

So, Steps 7 to 10 involve getting on I 96 West toward Lansing and then continuing on M 14 West after Step 10.

Now, after Step 10, we're on M 14 West towards Ann Arbor. So, the action of being on I 96 happened in Steps 7-10. After that, at Step 11, we take exit 45 onto M 14 West. Then, we go through various turns and eventually reach the destination.

So, is there any point after Step 10 where the effect of Step 8 (being on I 96) is used again? Let's see:

After Step 10, the route goes from I 96 to M 14 via exit 45. So, I 96 isn't used again after that. However, in Step 13, it mentions turning left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.

Wait, US 23 BUS is mentioned as part of the turn, but I 94 BL (which might be a business route) could intersect or connect back to I 96 somewhere else. But that's speculation; in reality, they are different roads.

But from a data-flow analysis perspective, we need to see if after Step 10, any step refers back to the action taken in Step 8.

Looking at Steps 11-17:

11: Keep left onto M 14.
12: Take exit 3 onto US 23 BUS.
13: Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS. Here, US 23 BUS is a different route, but I 94 BL might not be the same as I 96.

Wait, perhaps I 94 BL and I 96 are separate highways. So even if you turn onto I 94 BL, it's not the same as I 96 West.

Therefore, after Step 10, we leave I 96 and don't return to it again in the given steps. Therefore, the effect of being on I 96 (Step 8) isn't used again after Step 10.

Wait, but let me double-check: After Step 10, we're on M 14 West towards Ann Arbor. Then:

11. Keep left onto exit 45 to stay on M 14 West.
12. Take exit 3 onto US 23 BUS toward Downtown.
13. Turn left onto East Huron Street/I 94 BL/US 23 BUS.
14. Turn left onto North Division Street.
15. Turn right onto East Ann Street.
16. Continue for a bit.
17. Destination.

So, no further use of I 96 after Step 10. Therefore, the effect from Step 8 is not live after Step 10.

But wait, let me think again: The driver gets on I 96 at Step 7-10. Then, in Step 11, they take exit 45 to stay on M 14 West. So, leaving I 96. After that, no steps refer back to I 96. Therefore, the value (being on I 96) is not used again after Step 10.

So, the answer would be No.

  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on Lordship Boulevard, live at any point after Step 8?

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 3 is live at any point after Step 8 in the given travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what ""live variable analysis"" means here. From the benchmark provided, a variable is considered live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking for any point after Step 8 where the action from Step 3 might still have an impact on the current state of the driver's journey.

Looking at the steps:

Step 3: Turn right onto Lordship Boulevard/CT 113.
Step 8: Take the exit on the right after 54602 meters or 1904-2328 seconds. Then, bear right onto Mill Street/CT 372.

I need to see if Lordship Boulevard (from Step 3) is used again after Step 8.

After Step 8, the driver continues on CT 15 North toward Hartford and then takes another exit towards New Britain. The next steps involve turning left onto Polish Legion of American Veterans Memorial Highway, taking an exit, turning right onto New Britain Road/CT 71, continuing on CT 71, turning left onto Main Street, turning left onto Arch Street, and finally reaching the destination on the left.

I don't see any mention of Lordship Boulevard after Step 8. The driver is moving towards New Britain via various streets and roads but doesn't revisit Lordship Boulevard or CT 113 again. Therefore, the effect from Step 3 isn't used again later in the journey. So, it shouldn't be considered live after Step 8.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 2, the driver getting on CT 159, live at any point after Step 3?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of the driver getting on CT 159 in Step 2 is still ""live"" after Step 3. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what each step entails. 

Step 2: The driver turns right onto Palisado Avenue/CT 159 and continues on CT 159.
Step 3: The driver then turns right onto South Main Street/CT 159 and continues on CT 159.

So, in Step 2, the driver enters CT 159. Then in Step 3, they continue on CT 159 but turn onto South Main Street. Now, I need to determine if the initial action of getting on CT 159 in Step 2 is still having an effect after Step 3.

In data-flow analysis, a variable is ""live"" if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. Here, the state of being on CT 159 might be considered as a live variable because it's used continuously from Step 2 to Step 3 and beyond. The fact that they continue on CT 159 in Step 3 suggests that the initial entry onto CT 159 in Step 2 is still relevant as they are still on that road.

Furthermore, the continuation through Steps 4 onwards indicates that the state of being on CT 139 (from Step 4) and others might overwrite or change the variable, but the initial assignment to CT 159 in Step 2 hasn't been discarded yet when we reach Step 3. 

Therefore, based on this reasoning, the effect from Step 2 is still live at Step 3.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 9, the driver getting on US 4, live at any point after Step 13?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 9 is live after Step 13 in this travel route scenario. Let me start by breaking down what each step entails.

Step 9 says the driver ""Take exit 17 on the right onto US 4 toward NH 132/Penacook/Boscawen."" So, here, the driver enters US 4 via exit 17. This means that from this point onward, they're traveling on US 4 towards Penacook, Boscawen, etc.

Now, looking at Step 13: ""Turn right onto US 4 (NH)/US 4. Continue on US 4."" So, after some turns and other steps, the driver is turning right onto US 4 again, continuing their journey on it. 

The question is whether the effect of entering US 4 in Step 9 is live at any point after Step 13. A ""live"" variable is one whose value is used again later before being discarded. In this case, the action taken in Step 9 (entering US 4) affects the route because the driver continues on US 4 beyond that point.

So, from Step 9 onwards, the driver is on US 4, and at Step 13, they are still on US 4. Therefore, the effect of being on US 4 in Step 9 is used again later at Step 13 when they continue on it. This means the variable (being on US 4) is live after Step 13 because its value is reused.

Wait, but actually, once you take an exit onto US 4, are you still considered as being on US 4? Or does taking another turn onto US 4 again mean that you're re-entering it, so the effect is still present. So yes, the initial entry into US 4 in Step 9 influences the route, and since they continue on US 4 after Step 13, that effect is still active.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 16 is live after that step. Let me break it down.

First, let's understand what a ""live variable"" is. From the definition, a variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, in this context, I think we're looking at whether any steps after Step 16 use the same direction or information related to Upper Front Street.

Looking at Step 16: The driver turns left onto Upper Front Street/US 11. Now, after that step, let's check subsequent steps.

Step 17: Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto Upper Front Street/US 11 again. So they're going back to Upper Front Street. That means the action from Step 16 (getting on Upper Front Street) is used again in Step 17. Therefore, this effect is live because it's reused later.

I don't see any steps after that which might overwrite or discard the fact that they were on Upper Front Street. The only use of that street is in Steps 16 and 17, with another reference in Step 18 as well. So, yes, the effect from Step 16 is still live because it's used again later.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on Main Street, live at any point after Step 11?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 11 is live after that step. Let me break it down step by step.

First, what's happening at Step 11? The driver turns right onto Main Street/NH 106 and continues for about 420 meters or 29-36 seconds. The destination is on the right after this point.

Now, I need to see if any variables used in future steps depend on the value of what happened at Step 11. Variables are live if their values are used again before being discarded.

Let me list out the steps after Step 11:

Step 12: Continue for 420 meters or 29-36 seconds.
Step 13: Destination is on the right.

After that, there's no more steps mentioned, so the journey ends here. So, I need to check if any of the actions taken from Step 11 onwards use information about Main Street/NH 106 beyond just moving along it.

At Step 12, the driver continues straight on Main Street. The only action is moving forward, not using any previous steps' data except the current location.

Step 13 mentions the destination being on the right after continuing for a certain distance and time. Again, no use of information from Step 11 beyond the immediate movement.

So, the variable here (Main Street/NH 106) isn't used again in any meaningful way that affects future steps. The only effect is moving towards the destination, which doesn't require reusing the Main Street info.

Therefore, after Step 11, there's no further use of the information from Step 11 beyond just continuing the journey. So, the effect isn't live anymore.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 13 is live after that step. Let me break it down.

First, let's list out all the steps provided. The route has 15 steps, numbered from 1 to 15. The question is specifically about Step 13 and what happens afterward.

Step 1: Drive east on East Broad Street.
Step 2: Turn left onto North Orange Avenue.
Step 3: Bear left onto Orange Avenue.
Step 4: Bear left after 17 meters or 2 seconds.
Step 5: Turn right onto North Randolph Avenue.

Step 14: Keep left to stay on US 280/US 431.
Step 15: Turn left after 1894 meters or 80-98 seconds.

The question is about whether the effect of Step 13 (getting on US 280) is live after that step. So, I need to see if any of the subsequent steps use the information from being on US 280/US 431 after Step 13.

Looking at Steps 14 and 15: After Step 13, they keep left on US 280/US 431 in Step 14, and then in Step 15, they turn left again. So, the driver is still on US 280/US 431 after Step 13.

Therefore, the effect of being on US 280/US 431 from Step 13 continues to be used in Steps 14 and 15. Hence, it's live.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action taken in step 7 affects anything after step 11 in the given travel route. Let me break down each step and see how they connect.

Starting from step 1, the driver is taking various roads and eventually gets on I-10 East at step 7. Then, they keep going through several turns, exits, and changes in direction. By step 11, the driver takes exit 7 onto LA 23 South/LA 18 West towards Lafayette Street.

I need to determine if the decision made in step 7 (getting on I-10) is still relevant or has any effect after step 11. After step 7, the driver stays on I-10 until they take the exit at step 11. So, step 7's action directly leads up to step 11 because without getting on I-10, you wouldn't reach that point.

Looking further, after step 11, the route continues with more turns and eventually reaches the destination. The variable here is whether taking that specific ramp (step 7) affects anything later. Since the driver does take exit 7 as planned, it means that action was indeed necessary for the journey to proceed correctly. Therefore, there's a live effect from step 7 because the decision made there is used again at step 11.

So, yes, the effect from step 7 is live after step 11 because the driver continues on I-10 and later takes exit 7 as planned.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on Vanderbilt Avenue, live at any point after Step 11?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 11 is considered ""live"" after that step in the given travel route. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

First, the scenario involves driving from REX HOSPITAL to a specific destination in Raleigh, NC. The route consists of multiple steps with directions like turning left or right after certain meters or seconds.

The question is specifically about Step 11: ""Turn right onto Vanderbilt Avenue."" Then it asks if this effect is live at any point after Step 11. 

From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So I need to determine whether Vanderbilt Avenue's effect continues to influence the journey beyond Step 11.

Looking at the steps after Step 11:
- Step 12: ""Continue for 185 meters or 21-26 seconds.""
- The destination is on the left, which means the driver will turn and reach the end of the route.

Since Step 11 leads directly into Step 12, which is a continuation without any further directions related to Vanderbilt Avenue, it's possible that once you're on Vanderbilt Avenue, the effect might influence the path but perhaps not beyond that step. However, since the destination is mentioned as being on the left after continuing, the main variable here would be the direction taken at each turn.

Wait, but Step 11 is a specific action onto Vanderbilt Avenue, and then Step 12 is moving forward. There's no further use of Vanderbilt Avenue in the steps beyond that, so once you're past Step 11, the influence of being on Vanderbilt Avenue doesn't reappear. Therefore, the effect from Step 11 isn't used again after Step 11, making it not live.

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 19 is live at any point after Step 20 in the given travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. Step 19 says ""Turn right onto Upper Ridge Road."" So, after Step 18, which was ""Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto Gravel Pike/PA 29/PA 73,"" the driver turns right onto Upper Ridge Road. Now, I need to see if this action (getting on Upper Ridge Road) is used again later in the route.

Looking ahead to Step 20: ""Turn right to stay on Upper Ridge Road."" So, after being on Upper Ridge Road from Step 19, at Step 20, the driver turns right to continue on Upper Ridge Road. That means the same road is being used again immediately after. Therefore, the effect of Step 19 (entering Upper Ridge Road) is definitely used in Step 20.

But wait, I should check beyond Step 20 as well. Let me go through the rest of the steps. After Step 20, the driver continues on Upper Ridge Road, and then at Step 21: ""Turn left onto Gravel Pike/PA 29."" So they leave Upper Ridge Road here. But since Step 20 was using Upper Ridge Road, does that mean the effect is live beyond Step 19? Or is it only used in Step 20?

Hmm, the question is whether the effect from Step 19 (getting on Upper Ridge Road) is live at any point after Step 20. Since Step 20 uses the same road again, that would make the effect live. Even though later steps leave Upper Ridge Road, the fact that it was used in Step 20 makes the initial action's effect live at least once more.

So, putting it all together: Yes, because Step 20 re-uses the action from Step 19 by continuing on Upper Ridge Road.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 1, the driver getting on US 90 Alt, live at any point after Step 2?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 1 is live after Step 2 in the given travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what ""live variable analysis"" means here. From the definition, a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, in this context, we're looking at whether something from Step 1 (the driver getting on US 90 Alt) affects any point after Step 2.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 1: Drive southwest on US 77/US 90 Alt/Fairwinds Street and continue on US 90 Alt.
Step 2: Keep right to stay on US 90 Alt.

So, in Step 1, the driver starts on a route that includes US 90 Alt. In Step 2, they keep right to stay on US 90 Alt. That means their current path is still on US 90 Alt after Step 2.

Now, I need to check if any subsequent steps use information from Step 1 or the initial decision to be on US 90 Alt beyond Step 2. 

After Step 2, they turn right onto US 183 (Step 3) and take several more steps, including taking exits and turning left or right multiple times. The route continues south on TX 130 and then takes other roads like I-410 and Spur 122.

I'm trying to see if any part of the journey after Step 2 relies on information from Step 1. Since they continue on US 90 Alt in Step 1 and keep right onto it in Step 2, that action affects their path through Gonzales, Cuero, Luling, etc., as per Step 4.

Wait, but does any subsequent step use the fact that they were on US 90 Alt earlier? They might be using the same road later, which could mean the initial choice influences the route. However, in live analysis, we're looking for if the value (action) is used again after being set. 

In this case, the decision to take US 90 Alt affects their current position and path but isn't explicitly referenced again beyond that point. They continue on other roads without making a specific reference back to having taken US 90 Alt.

Alternatively, maybe the initial direction on US 90 Alt sets their southbound route on TX 130 via I-10, which is step 5 and onwards. So, the choice in Step 1 influences how they get to their destination but isn't used again as a decision point after Step 2. 

I'm not sure if this counts as 'live' because the initial action's effect is ongoing but not explicitly referenced later on. Perhaps the effect is no longer needed after Step 2, so it might not be live.

Wait, maybe I should think about variables in terms of data flow. If the variable representing being on US 90 Alt is used again beyond Step 2, then yes. But in this scenario, after Step 2, they're already on US 90 Alt but then make a turn onto US 183, so it's no longer relevant for future steps.

So, probably, the effect from Step 1 isn't used again after Step 2. Therefore, it's not live.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 13, the driver getting on Sewell Drive, live at any point after Step 13?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 13 in this travel route is considered ""live"" after that step. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what a ""live variable"" means here. From the benchmark definition, a live variable is one whose value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking for if the action taken in Step 13 affects any subsequent steps.

Looking at the route steps provided, let's list them out with their order for clarity:

1. Drive southeast.
2. Turn left onto Hangar Lane.
3. Turn left onto Donelson Pike/SR 255.
4. Turn right to take the I 40 ramp.
5. Take exit 221A on the right onto TN 45 North toward The Hermitage.
6. Keep right to take SR 265 East toward Central Pike.
7. Turn right onto Central Pike.
8. Turn right onto SR 109/SR 265/Central Pike.
9. Turn right onto Sparta Pike/US 70. Continue on US 70.
10. Turn left onto Old Smithville Road.
11. Turn right to stay on Old Smithville Road.
12. Turn right onto Roosevelt Drive.
13. Turn left onto Sewell Drive.
14. Continue for 684 meters or 58-70 seconds.
15. Destination is on the left.

So, Step 13 is turning left onto Sewell Drive. The question is whether this action's effect is live after Step 13.

After Step 13, in Step 14, the driver continues straight on Sewell Drive for a certain distance and time. Then, in Step 15, the destination is on the left. So, the continued driving on Sewell Drive might affect where the destination is located relative to the current position.

I think that the action of turning onto Sewell Drive at Step 13 affects the subsequent steps because it changes the direction and path the driver will take. The continued movement on Sewell Drive (Step 14) uses this turn, and the destination placement (Step 15) depends on where the driver is after traveling on Sewell Drive.

Therefore, the effect of Step 13 is likely live because it influences the subsequent steps by determining the road the driver is on, which in turn affects where the destination is located. So, the answer should be ""Yes.""

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action in step 16 affects anything after step 17 in this travel route. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what each step is doing. Step 16 says the driver turns right onto Shady Avenue/Blue Belt. So they're entering Shady Avenue at that point. Then, step 17 mentions continuing on Shady Avenue for a certain distance and time before turning again.

Now, the question is whether the effect of step 16 (being on Shady Avenue) is live after step 17. A live variable means its value will be used again in the future. In this case, the action at step 16 is the driver being on Shady Avenue. Step 17 continues that by keeping the driver on Shady Avenue.

So, since step 17 continues on Shady Avenue, the effect from step 16 (being on Shady Avenue) is definitely used again in the next step. Therefore, it's live after step 17.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 7 is live after Step 8 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps for clarity:

1. Drive southeast.
2. Turn left onto Hangar Lane.
3. Turn left onto Donelson Pike/SR 255.
4. Turn right to take the I 40 ramp.
5. Take exit 221A on the right onto TN 45 North toward The Hermitage.
6. Keep right to take SR 265 East toward Central Pike.
7. Turn right onto Central Pike.
8. Turn right onto SR 109/SR 265/Central Pike.
9. Turn right onto Sparta Pike/US 70. Continue on US 70.
10. Turn left onto Old Smithville Road.
11. Turn right to stay on Old Smithville Road.
12. Turn right onto Roosevelt Drive.
13. Turn left onto Sewell Drive.
14. Continue for 684 meters or 58-70 seconds.
15. Destination is on the left.

The question is asking if, after Step 8, there's any point where the driver's action (from Step 7) getting onto Central Pike is still live. That means we need to see if the decision made at Step 7 affects anything that happens later beyond Step 8.

Step 7: Turn right onto Central Pike.
Step 8: Turn right onto SR 109/SR 265/Central Pike.

So, after Step 8, the driver is now on SR 109/SR 265/Central Pike. Wait a second, that's exactly where they were heading in Step 8. So turning right in Step 7 was to get onto Central Pike, and then in Step 8, they're turning again onto Central Pike as part of SR 109 or SR 265.

So the effect at Step 7 is directly followed by an action at Step 8 that continues on Central Pike. That means the driver's decision to turn right in Step 7 is immediately used again in Step 8 without being discarded or overwritten yet.

Now, after Step 8, they continue on Central Pike, which was already set up in Step 7. So any further actions dependent on being on Central Pike would still be influenced by Step 7's decision until the next significant change occurs, like at Step 9 when they turn onto Sparta Pike/US 70.

Therefore, the effect from Step 7 is definitely live after Step 8 because they're continuing on that same road.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on I 215, live at any point after Step 5?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, let's try to figure out if the effect from Step 3 is still live after Step 5 in this travel planning scenario. 

So, first, I need to understand what each step entails. Step 3 is where the driver gets on I-215. That action seems pretty significant because it's the starting point of their journey towards San Diego.

Now, looking at Step 5: Keep right to stay on I 215/CA 60/Escondido Freeway. So after taking the ramp onto I-215 in Step 3, they continue on I-215 through Step 4 and then Step 5. The question is whether this initial action of getting on I-215 (Step 3) has any live effect after Step 5.

A ""live"" variable, as per the benchmark, means its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. In terms of a travel route, this would imply that the action taken in Step 3 is somehow affecting something later on in the journey beyond just the continuation on I-215.

Hmm. When they take the ramp onto I-215 in Step 3, they're entering the freeway. Then in Step 4, they keep left to stay on the same road, which is I-215/CA 60/Escondido Freeway. In Step 5, they keep right again to remain on the same highway. So up until Step 5, they're still on I-215.

But then, after Step 5, do they continue on I-215? Let's check the subsequent steps: Step 6 is taking exit 31 towards Valley Parkway, which seems like an exit from I-215. So in Step 3, they get onto I-215, and in Step 6, they take an exit off of it.

Does this mean that the action in Step 3 (getting on I-215) affects anything beyond just being on that road until exit 31? It seems like getting on I-215 is necessary to reach Valley Parkway via exit 31, but once they take that exit, are there any further uses of the fact that they were on I-215?

Wait, perhaps the action itself isn't directly used again, but it's part of the route that leads to other actions. However, in terms of variable analysis, a live variable is one whose value is used again after Step 5.

I'm not entirely sure if just being on the road counts as a live effect or if there needs to be an explicit use of the action taken in Step 3 beyond its immediate consequences. Since they exit I-215 at Step 6, maybe the initial action isn't ""used"" again beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that they were on I-215 influences their route choices later on, but if that's the case, then it would be live. But I think in terms of data-flow analysis, a variable is live if its value affects future steps. So getting onto I-215 (Step 3) might set certain parameters for future actions like keeping left or right at certain points.

But wait, Step 5 is about staying on I-215 after continuing from the ramp in Step 4. So after Step 5, they're still on I-215 until Step 6. Therefore, the action of getting on I-215 (Step 3) is used again in Steps 4 and 5 as part of their journey. However, once they take exit 31 at Step 6, the effect of being on I-215 might be over.

But does that mean that the effect from Step 3 is no longer live after Step 5? Because by Step 5, they're still on I-215, but then in Step 6, they leave it. So perhaps the initial action (Step 3) affects their route up until Step 5, and after that, it's no longer necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the variable representing being on I-215 is live because its state continues to affect future steps even beyond Step 5 until the exit is taken. But once they take the exit at Step 6, the effect might be considered no longer live.

I'm a bit confused here. On one hand, the action in Step 3 affects their route through Steps 4 and 5 because they're still on I-215. So the variable is used again. On the other hand, after taking the exit at Step 6, that action might be considered as no longer live.

Wait, but the question is specifically about whether the effect from Step 3 is live after Step 5. So up to Step 5, they're still on I-215, so the variable (being on I-215) is definitely used again in Steps 4 and 5. Therefore, it's a live variable.

But when does the effect of being on I-215 stop being relevant? It stops at Step 6 because that's when they exit. So after Step 5, they're still on I-215 until Step 6. Therefore, the effect is used again in Steps 4 and 5, making it live.

So, putting this together: Yes, the effect from Step 3 (getting on I-215) is used again in Steps 4 and 5, meaning it's live after Step 5.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 9 is live after Step 13 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. The goal is to get from Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PHILADELPHIA) to St Luke's Hospital Monroe Campus in Stroudsburg, PA.

Looking at the steps:

Step 9: Keep right to take Easton Road.
So here, the driver is turning right onto Easton Road. I'm assuming that this action affects the current direction or road they're on, specifically switching from whatever they were previously on (maybe US-676?) to Easton Road.

Now, Step 13: Turn left onto North 9th Street/PA 611.
This step involves another turn, this time a left onto North 9th Street, which is part of PA 611. So now the driver is moving onto North 9th Street, which is a segment of PA 611.

The question is whether the effect from Step 9 (taking Easton Road) is still live after Step 13. ""Live"" here means that the variable (effect) is still used again in the future before being discarded or overwritten.

In data-flow analysis terms, variables can be live if their values are used later on. So, if at any point after Step 9, PA 611 (or Easton Road as part of it) is used again, then the effect from Step 9 would still be live.

Looking further into the steps beyond Step 13:

After Step 13, the route continues with more turns onto PA 611 and other streets. For example, Step 14: Turn right to stay on PA 611. So, after turning left onto North 9th Street (which is PA 611), they then turn right to remain on PA 611.

This indicates that PA 611 is being used multiple times beyond Step 13. Therefore, the initial effect from Step 9, which involved getting on PA 611 via Easton Road, is indeed referenced and used again in future steps (like Steps 14, 15, etc.). Thus, the effect is still live after Step 13.

Given the following travel planning scenario:

  Goal: ST MARY'S MEDICAL CENTER (HUNTINGTON, WV) to Mid Ohio Valley Regional Airport (PARKERSBURG (WILLIAMSTOWN), WV)

  Route steps:
['Drive southwest.', 'Make a sharp left after 6 meters or 1 seconds.', 'Turn right onto 29th Street.', 'Turn left onto 5th Avenue/US 60.', 'Turn left onto 31st Street/US 60.', 'Turn right onto 3rd Avenue/WV 2.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on WV 2, live at any point after Step 14?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the effect from Step 11 is live at any point after Step 14 in this travel route. Let me start by understanding what each step entails.

Step 11 says ""Turn left onto Williamstown Pike/WV 31."" So, the driver is turning onto WV 2/Emerson Avenue here. I think that means they're now on WV 2.

Moving to Step 14: ""Continue for 905 meters or 78-95 seconds."" This is the point where the user arrives at their destination, Mid Ohio Valley Regional Airport in Parkersburg (Williamstown), WV.

Now, the question is whether the action from Step 11 (getting on WV 2) has a live effect after Step 14. A live variable, as per the definition, is one whose value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I need to see if the fact that they're on WV 2 at Step 11 is somehow relevant again after arriving at the airport.

Looking at the steps, after Step 11, the route continues with more turns and eventually arrives at the destination in Step 14. There doesn't seem to be any further use of WV 2 after turning onto it, except that they're continuing on it until arrival.

Wait, but the question is about whether the effect (the state of being on WV 2) is live after Step 14. Once they arrive at the airport, are there any subsequent uses of the information from when they were on WV 2?

In this scenario, once they reach the airport, the journey ends. So, the state from Step 11 isn't used again; it's just part of the path leading to the destination.

But maybe I'm missing something. Sometimes in data flow analysis, even if a variable is set earlier, if it's not referenced later, it might not be considered live. However, in this case, since the arrival at the airport is the end point and there are no further actions, the state of being on WV 2 isn't used again.

Therefore, I think the answer would be ""No"" because after Step 14, there's no use or reference to the fact that they were on WV 2 in Step 11.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect of the driver being on Trumbull Street in step 15 is used again later in the travel route. Let me go through each step carefully.

Step 1: Drive north on Dean Street. Probably sets the initial direction.

Step 2: Turn left onto Burr Street. So, now going west maybe?

Step 3: Turn right onto Ley Street. Hmm, so another turn, not sure about direction.

Step 4: Turn right onto Townsend Avenue/CT 337. Okay, still making turns but not sure yet.

Step 5: Turn left onto Forbes Avenue/US 1. Now this is a major highway, US 1, heading east or west?

Wait, step 15 is turning left onto Trumbull Street. So at that point, the driver is on Trumbull Street. The question is whether this action affects anything after step 15.

Looking ahead, step 16 says continue for 42 meters or 8-9 seconds. Then step 17: destination is on the left.

So after step 15, the only thing mentioned is continuing a bit more and then arriving at the destination. There's no further use of Trumbull Street beyond that point. So I think the effect from step 15 isn't used again later.

  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on Valley Road, live at any point after Step 12?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the action in Step 10, where the driver gets onto Valley Road, has an effect that's live after Step 12. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive northwest.
2. Turn left after 213 meters or 34-41 seconds.
3. Turn left onto Meadowlands Parkway.
4. Take the NJTP/NJ 3 West ramp on the right.
5. Take the NJ 21 exit on the right toward Paterson/Newark.
6. Keep right to take NJ 21 South.
7. Keep right to take NJ 21 South toward Newark.
8. Turn right onto Center Street/CR 508. Continue on CR 508.
9. Turn left onto Carteret Place/CR 508. Continue on CR 508.
10. Turn right onto Valley Road/CR 508. Continue on CR 508.
11. Bear right to stay on Valley Road/CR 508.
12. Turn left onto Whittingham Place/CR 508. Continue on CR 508.

The question is asking if the effect of Step 10 (getting on Valley Road) is live at any point after Step 12. A ""live"" variable is one whose value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded.

So, I need to see if getting onto Valley Road in Step 10 affects any subsequent steps beyond Step 12. Let me check each step from Step 13 onwards to see if there's any reference that might require knowing that they're on Valley Road after Step 10.

Looking at the steps:

13. Turn left onto Gregory Avenue/CR 508. Continue on CR 508.
14. Turn right onto South Orange Avenue/CR 510/CR 577.
15. Turn right after 13770 meters or 655-800 seconds.
16. Keep left at the fork.
17. Continue for 592 meters or 77-94 seconds.
18. You have arrived at your destination.

None of these steps mention Valley Road again after Step 10, except in Steps 11 and 12, which are before Step 13. Step 11 is about staying on Valley Road, and Step 12 is turning left onto Whittingham Place from Valley Road. So, the action in Step 10 affects being on Valley Road in Steps 10-11.

After Step 12, the driver turns off Valley Road. So, after that point (Step 13 onwards), they are not on Valley Road anymore. Therefore, any information about being on Valley Road before Step 12 isn't used again beyond that.

So, does the effect from Step 10 (being on Valley Road) become irrelevant or unused after Step 12? Yes, because once you leave Valley Road in Step 12, it's not referenced again later. Therefore, the effect is not live after Step 12.

  Is the effect from Step 8, the driver getting on Grand Concourse, live at any point after Step 10?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 8 is live after Step 10 in the given travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. The goal is to get from Catt, Carrie Chapman, House (Briarcliff Manor, NY) to Poe Cottage (New York, NY). The steps provided are a list of directions that the driver will follow.

Step 8 says ""Turn right onto Grand Concourse."" So at this point, the driver has turned onto Grand Concourse. Now, I need to see if this action affects any part of the journey after Step 10.

Looking at Step 10: ""Make a left U-turn at East 192nd Street to stay on Grand Concourse."" This step involves making a U-turn at East 192nd Street to remain on Grand Concourse. So, the driver is still on Grand Concourse here but has taken an action that keeps them on it.

Then, Step 11 says ""Continue for 122 meters or 18-22 seconds."" After this, Step 12 indicates that the destination is on the right. So, after continuing, the driver reaches the destination, which is Poe Cottage.

Now, considering the definition of a live variable: a variable is live if its value is used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, the effect from Step 8 is getting onto Grand Concourse. I need to check if this action (being on Grand Concourse) is used again after Step 10.

In Step 10, the driver makes a U-turn to stay on Grand Concourse, which means they are still on it. Then, in Step 11, they continue on Grand Concourse for some distance before reaching the destination. So, the action from Step 8 (getting onto Grand Concourse) is indeed used again after Step 10.

Therefore, yes, the effect from Step 8 is live at least once after Step 10.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on I 79, live at any point after Step 4?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the action in Step 3 is still going to have an effect after Step 4. Let me break it down.

Step 3 says the driver gets on I 79. Then in Step 4, they keep left to stay on I 79 North. So, getting on I 79 and then continuing on I 79 doesn't change much. The variable here is probably the current road being driven on, which is still I 79.

Now, the question is whether this effect (still being on I 79) is live after Step 4. Live variables are those whose values are used again later. So, does the driver use the fact that they're on I 79 North again in any future step?

Looking at the remaining steps, after Step 4, the next steps involve turning right onto PA 18 and so on. None of these mention I 79 again. But wait, in Step 5, they take the exit for I 70 West, which is a different highway, but maybe there's more to it.

Is there any step where they might need to know if they were still on I 79? Well, after exiting I 79, their current road changes, so perhaps at some point, they might need to know that they've left I 79. But in this specific route, the only time they're on I 79 is from Step 3 to Step 4.

However, the question is whether the effect (being on I 79) is used again after Step 4. Since Step 5 onwards doesn't reference I 79, maybe it's not used again. But wait, in Step 5, they take exit 17 onto PA 18. If their current road was I 79 and they're taking an exit off of it, perhaps the variable is whether they were on I 79 before exiting.

But actually, once you take the exit, you're no longer on I 79, so maybe the effect is only that they were on I 79, but after Step 4, it's no longer relevant because they've already exited. So the live effect might be whether they are currently on I 79, which would be until Step 4. After that, it's no longer applicable.

So, in conclusion, since the driver continues on I 79 from Step 3 to Step 4 but doesn't use this fact again later, the effect isn't used after Step 4. Therefore, the answer is No.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of Step 13 is live at any point after Step 19 in the given travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive west.
2. Turn left after 29 meters or 4-5 seconds.
3. Turn right onto Greenley Road.
4. Turn left onto Mono Way.
5. Turn right to take the ramp.
6. Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto CA 49/CA 108.
7. Turn right onto O'Byrnes Ferry Road/E15. Continue on E15.
8. Turn left onto CA 4.
9. Turn right to take the CA 99 ramp.
10. Keep right to stay on CA 4.
11. Keep right to take exit 65A/65B to stay on CA 4 toward Sacramento.
12. Keep left to take I 5 South.
13. Take exit 471 on the right onto CA 4 West/Charter Way.
14. Keep right to take CA 4.
15. Turn left onto CA 4/Marsh Creek Road.
16. Turn right to stay on CA 4.
17. Keep right to take CA 242 toward Oakland/Concord.
18. Take the exit on the right toward Solano Way/Grant Street.
19. Turn left onto Grant Street.
20. Turn left after 494 meters or 31-38 seconds.
21. Turn left after 86 meters or 17-21 seconds.
22. Turn left after 15 meters or 4-5 seconds.
23. Turn right after 102 meters or 18-22 seconds.
24. Continue for 77 meters or 15-18 seconds.
25. Your destination is on the left.

Now, Step 13 is where the driver gets onto CA 4. The question is whether this effect (the driver being on CA 4) is live after Step 19.

Looking at Step 19: Turn left onto Grant Street. After that, there are several turns and directions given until the destination is reached. I need to check if any of these steps use or refer back to CA 4 again after Step 19.

From Step 13, the driver is on CA 4. Then in Step 14, they keep right to take CA 4. So at this point, they're still on CA 4. Steps 15 and 16 also mention keeping right and staying on CA 4. So up until Step 16, they are definitely on CA 4.

Then, Step 17 says to turn right onto CA 242 towards Oakland/Concord. That takes them off of CA 4, so the effect of being on CA 4 is no longer relevant here.

After that, Steps 18 and 19 involve exiting CA 4 when they take CA 242 and then turning left onto Grant Street in Step 19. From this point on, until the destination is reached at Step 25, they are on Grant Street and other streets, not CA 4 anymore.

Looking further down, after Step 19, the next steps involve turning left several times (Steps 20-22), then a right (Step 23), continuing (Step 24), and finally reaching the destination. None of these mention CA 4 again; instead, they're on Grant Street, then various streets as they proceed towards the destination.

So, after Step 19, the driver is no longer on CA 4 but is moving onto other roads. Therefore, the effect from Step 13 (being on CA 4) doesn't occur again after Step 19. Hence, the effect isn't live anymore.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 18, the driver getting on North Union Drive, live at any point after Step 19?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 18 is live after Step 19 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what a ""live variable"" means according to the benchmark provided. A variable is considered live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. So, I need to determine if the action taken in Step 18 affects anything that happens after that point, specifically looking at whether it's used again later.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 18: Turn left to stay on North Union Drive.
Step 19: Bear right onto Lone Beech Road.

So, in Step 18, the driver is turning left to remain on North Union Drive. Now, the question is whether this action has any effect after Step 19. Let me check the subsequent steps.

After Step 19, the route continues with several turns and directions, but importantly, Step 20 mentions bearing right onto Lone Beech Road. So, the driver is turning right here. 

Wait, but in Step 18, they were already on North Union Drive, and then they turned left to stay on it. Then in Step 19, they bear right from North Union Drive onto Lone Beech Road. So, after that, does the fact that they were on North Union Drive in Step 18 affect anything further?

Looking ahead, let's see if any future steps reference North Union Drive or if there's a turnback to it. Let me check all the remaining steps:

Step 19: Bear right onto Lone Beech Road.
Step 20: Turn right onto North State Street.
Step 21: Turn left after 422 meters or 44-54 seconds.
Step 22: Bear right onto North Market Street/IL 105.
Step 23: Turn left to stay on IL 105.
Step 24: Turn right onto Medical Center Drive.
Step 25: Turn left after 345 meters or 37-45 seconds.
Step 26: Continue for 133 meters or 46-56 seconds.

None of these steps mention North Union Drive again. After Step 19, the driver leaves North Union Drive and moves to Lone Beech Road, then proceeds through several streets leading towards the Medical Center Drive.

So, since the action in Step 18 (turning left onto North Union Drive) only affects the current step and doesn't impact any subsequent steps beyond Step 19, it's not used again later. Therefore, the effect from Step 18 isn't live after Step 19.

  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on MA 110, live at any point after Step 14?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 11 is live after Step 14 in this travel route planning scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what each step entails:

Step 11 says ""Turn right onto MA 110."" So at this point, the driver is getting onto Massachusetts Route 110.

Now, looking ahead to Step 14: ""Continue for 74 meters or 10-12 seconds."" The wording here suggests that after turning onto MA 110 in Step 11, the driver continues straight on MA 110 for a certain distance and time. The action at Step 14 doesn't involve any turns or changes in direction; it's just continuing along the same road.

Since the effect from Step 11 is the driver being on MA 110, this value (the fact that they are on MA 110) is used again later in Step 14 when they continue on the same route. Therefore, the value from Step 11 is definitely used after Step 14. 

Wait, no, actually, Step 14 comes right after Step 11, so it's not after Step 14 but during the continuation. However, the question is whether the effect from Step 11 (turning onto MA 110) is live at any point after Step 14.

So, in other words, does being on MA 110 after Step 11 have an effect or influence beyond that step? Since they continue on MA 110 through Step 14 and beyond, their position or state of being on MA 110 is definitely used again later. Therefore, the effect from Step 11 should still be live after Step 14.

Given the following travel planning scenario:

  Goal: ST ELIZABETH YOUNGSTOWN HOSPITAL (YOUNGSTOWN, OH) to EAST OHIO REGIONAL HOSPITAL (MARTINS FERRY, OH)

  Route steps:
['Drive southeast.', 'Turn right onto Park Avenue.', 'Turn left onto Wirt Street/SR 193.', 'Turn right onto Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard/US 422. Continue on US 422.', 'Turn left to take the US 422 ramp toward Girard.', 'Keep left to take exit 224 to stay on SR 11 South toward Canfield.', 'Take the exit on the right after 63726 meters or 1877-2294 seconds.', 'Turn right onto SR 213.', 'Turn left onto SR 152/SR 213.', 'Turn right to stay on SR 213.', 'Turn left to stay on SR 213.', 'Turn right to take the US 22 East ramp.', 'Keep left to take exit 244A to stay on Dean Martin Boulevard.', 'Turn right onto North Zane Highway.', 'Bear right to stay on North Zane Highway.', 'Turn left onto Hanover Street/SR 647.', 'Turn left onto North 4th Street.', 'Continue for 345 meters or 34-41 seconds.', 'Your destination is on the right.']

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on SR 213, live at any point after Step 15?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 10 is live at any point after Step 15 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, let's list out the steps provided:

1. Drive southeast.
2. Turn right onto Park Avenue.
3. Turn left onto Wirt Street/SR 193.
4. Turn right onto Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard/US 422.
5. Continue on US 422.
6. Turn left to take the US 422 ramp toward Girard.
7. Keep left to take exit 224 to stay on SR 11 South toward Canfield.
8. Take the exit on the right after 63726 meters or 1877-2294 seconds.
9. Turn right onto SR 213.
10. Turn left onto SR 152/SR 213.
11. Turn right to stay on SR 213.
12. Turn left to stay on SR 213.
13. Turn right to take the US 22 East ramp.
14. Keep left to take exit 244A to stay on Dean Martin Boulevard.
15. Turn right onto North Zane Highway.

So, Step 10 is turning left onto SR 152/SR 213, which I assume means getting onto that road. The question is whether this action has an effect that's still active (live) after Step 15.

I think a live variable or effect in data flow analysis refers to whether the value or state created by that step is used again later. So if at Step 10, the driver is on SR 213, does that fact get used again after Step 15?

Looking at the steps beyond 10:

11. Turn right to stay on SR 213.
12. Turn left to stay on SR 213.
13. Take US 22 East ramp.
14. Keep left to take exit 244A.
15. Turn right onto North Zane Highway.

So after Step 10, in Steps 11 and 12, the driver is still on SR 213. So the fact that they turned onto SR 213 at Step 10 is definitely used again in Steps 11 and 12. That means the effect from Step 10 is indeed live after Step 15.

Wait, but the question specifically asks if it's live ""after Step 15."" After Step 15, the driver is on North Zane Highway. So does any part of SR 213 usage affect that?

Well, at Step 11 and 12, the driver is still on SR 213. Then they take a ramp to US 22 East (Step 13), then exit onto Dean Martin Boulevard (Step 14), and finally turn right onto North Zane Highway (Step 15). So after Step 15, they're no longer on SR 213.

But the original effect from Step 10 is that they entered SR 213. That was used in Steps 11 and 12, so it's live up until Step 14 or 15. So technically, after Step 15, that effect has been left behind, but during Step 15, they are still on SR 213 for part of the route.

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify: does ""live"" mean whether the state is used again at any point after Step 15, or if it's active while proceeding beyond Step 15. Since in Steps 11 and 12, they're continuing on SR 213, that effect is still live during those steps. After Step 15, they've left SR 213, so the effect from Step 10 is no longer active.

Wait, but the question says ""after Step 15,"" so after all steps have been executed beyond Step 15, is there any usage of the state created in Step 10? Since Steps 11-12 are part of the same route as Step 10, perhaps they're still on SR 213 during those steps, which would mean the effect is live at that time. But after Step 15, they've moved past it.

So I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about whether the variable representing being on SR 213 is used again after Step 15. Since Steps 11 and 12 are before Step 13, which exits onto another road, perhaps the effect is used during those steps but not beyond.

Alternatively, maybe it's considered live as long as there's usage within the future steps, regardless of when exactly. So since Steps 11 and 12 use the SR 213 state, they occur after Step 10, making the effect live at least until Step 12.

So, to sum up, the driver is on SR 213 from Step 10 through Steps 11 and 12. Therefore, the effect of Step 10 is indeed live during those subsequent steps, which are before Step 15. So after Step 15, that effect has passed, but it was used in Steps 11 and 12, so technically, yes, it's live at least until Step 12, which is before Step 15.

Wait, no. The question specifically asks if it's live ""after Step 15."" So after all steps up to and beyond Step 15 have been taken, is there any use of the effect from Step 10? Since Steps 11-12 are before Step 13, which leads to exiting SR 213, so after Step 15, they've already left SR 213. Therefore, the effect from Step 10 isn't used again after Step 15.

I think I need to clarify this point because it's a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the state created in Step 10 is used again in any step after Step 15. Since Steps 11 and 12 are before exiting SR 213, but they are part of continuing on SR 213, so during those steps, the effect is still active. But once they leave SR 213 at Step 13, that state is no longer relevant.

So, strictly speaking, after Step 15, the driver has already left SR 213. Therefore, the effect from Step 10 isn't used again after Step 15. So the answer would be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 7, the driver getting on I 10, live at any point after Step 10?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 7 is still alive after Step 10 in the given travel route scenario. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps provided:

1. Drive south.
2. Turn right after 157 meters or 26-31 seconds.
3. Turn right after 161 meters or 30-36 seconds.
4. Enter roundabout and take the second exit.
5. Turn right onto South Val Vista Drive.
6. Turn left to take AZ 202 Loop West ramp.
7. Take exit 55C onto I 10 West.
8. Keep left to take I 10/Papago Freeway.
9. Take exit 148 on the right toward Washington Street.
10. Keep left toward Washington Street.
11. Continue toward I 10 East.
12. Turn left onto East Washington Street.
13. Keep left to stay on East Washington Street (repeated several times).
14. Turn right onto North 3rd Street.
15. Turn right after 323 meters or 43-53 seconds.
16. Continue for 61 meters or 19-23 seconds.
17. Arrived at destination.

Now, the question is about Step 7: getting on I 10 West. We need to determine if this effect is ""live"" at any point after Step 10. 

A variable is live if its value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, in this context, the action taken at Step 7 is taking exit 55C onto I 10 West. The question is whether this event's effect influences anything happening from Step 11 onward.

Looking at Step 11: Continue toward I 10 East. That suggests that after some turns and exits, the driver might be approaching I 10 again but heading east now. So, being on I 10 West at Step 7 could be relevant because later on, they take I 10 East. 

Wait, but in Step 8, they keep left to take I 10/Papago Freeway, which is still westbound (I 10 West). Then in Step 11, it says ""Continue toward I 10 East."" That might mean that after some turns, the driver is getting onto I 10 East. So, perhaps the initial entrance at Step 7 onto I 10 West is relevant because later they switch to I 10 East.

But actually, Step 11 seems to be about continuing on I 10/Papago Freeway, which is still westbound. Then in Step 12, turning left onto East Washington Street. So perhaps the I 10 West from Step 7 isn't directly influencing anything beyond that point because they're exiting at Step 9 (exit 148) towards Washington Street.

Wait, but then in Step 11, after continuing on I 10/Papago Freeway (westbound), they take exit 148 to Washington Street. Then in Step 12 and onwards, they're moving through East Washington Street, so perhaps the initial entrance onto I 10 West is used only for that segment and then they leave, making it not live anymore.

Wait, but let me clarify: After exiting at 148, they keep left towards Washington Street (Step 10), continue toward I 10 East (Step 11). Hmm, so after exit 148, they might be heading east on I 10. So the initial entrance onto I 10 West at Step 7 is no longer relevant once they take exit 148 because they're leaving the highway. Therefore, the effect from Step 7 isn't used again after that point.

Alternatively, if in Step 11, ""Continue toward I 10 East"" implies that they are still on I 10/Papago Freeway (westbound) but continuing towards where? Wait, no, because taking exit 148 would mean exiting the freeway. So perhaps after exit 148, they're on surface streets.

So, to summarize:

- At Step 7: Enter I 10 West.
- In Step 8: Keep left to stay on I 10/Papago Freeway (still westbound).
- At Step 9: Take exit 148 onto Washington Street.
- So, the effect of entering I 10 West at Step 7 is used when they take exit 148. After that, they're no longer on I 10 West but have exited onto surface streets.

Therefore, after Step 10, which is ""Keep left toward Washington Street,"" they are off the freeway. The next steps involve moving through East Washington Street and so on.

So, the action at Step 7 (entering I 10 West) is used when taking exit 148 (Step 9), but that's before Step 10. After Step 10, they're on surface streets, not on I 10 anymore. Therefore, the effect from Step 7 isn't used again after Step 10.

Wait, no. Let me check again:

- Step 7: Take exit 55C onto I 10 West.
- Step 8: Keep left to take I 10/Papago Freeway (still westbound).
- Step 9: Take exit 148 on the right toward Washington Street.
- Step 10: Keep left toward Washington Street.
- Then, they continue toward I 10 East in Step 11? Wait, that seems conflicting.

Wait, no. Let me read the steps again:

After Step 9: Take exit 148 on the right toward Washington Street.

Then Step 10: Keep left toward Washington Street.

So, after exiting I 10 West at exit 148, they are moving onto surface streets towards Washington Street. Then in Step 11, it says ""Continue toward I 10 East."" Hmm, that suggests that from some point, they continue on a road towards I 10 East. But if they've already taken the exit, perhaps they're approaching another I 10 East later.

Wait, but that might not be directly related to the initial entrance at Step 7. The action in Step 7 is taking I 10 West, then exiting at 148. So, the effect of being on I 10 West is only until they exit. After that, they're off the highway.

Therefore, after Step 10, which is on surface streets, there's no further use of I 10 West from Step 7. Hence, the effect isn't live anymore after Step 10.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 18, the driver getting on US 30, live at any point after Step 18?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the variable from Step 18 is live after that step in the given travel route. Let me break it down.

First, the scenario is about driving from York Hospital to Reading Regional Airport. The steps are a list of directions from 'Drive southeast.' all the way to the final arrival. 

Step 18 says ""Turn right to take the US 30 East ramp toward Lancaster."" So at this point, the driver is getting on US 30 East. Now, the question is whether this action (getting on US 30) affects any steps that come after Step 18 in a way that might make it live again.

Live variables are those whose values will be used again before being discarded. So I need to see if US 30 or anything related to it is used later in the route.

Looking through the rest of the steps: After Step 18, they continue on PA 283 West toward Harrisburg/Downtown Lancaster, then take exits and forks, go onto Chester Road, PA 272/Oregon Pike, Wabash Road, High School Road, Lancaster Avenue, South 4th Street, Main Street, North 6th Street, US 422/Penn Avenue, Mull Avenue, take the US 222 North ramp toward Allentown, take PA 183 exit on the right toward Bernville Road/Strausstown, keep right to take PA 183 South toward Reading Airport/Reading, turn left onto Van Reed Road, right onto Arnold Road, right onto General Spaatz Drive, left onto Air Museum Drive, continue for a bit, and then arrive.

I need to check if US 30 is mentioned again after Step 18. The only mention of US 30 is in Step 18 itself and when taking the ramp, but I don't see it again later on. However, PA 183 is mentioned towards the end as leading to Reading Airport, which is the destination.

PA 183 West exit is taken, then South toward Reading Airport/Reading. So after that, they turn left onto Van Reed Road, etc., until arrival. 

Wait, Step 18 mentions US 30 East ramp, but PA 30 isn't mentioned again except when getting on it. But perhaps the variable representing being on US 30 might be used again later? Or maybe the action itself is considered live if the route continues past that point.

Alternatively, since the driver is taking the US 30 East exit and then moving onto PA 283, but PA 30 isn't mentioned again. So unless the same highway number is reused, it's not necessarily live. 

But in data-flow analysis, variables are often about whether their value affects future steps, even if indirectly. If getting on US 30 affects the route in a way that influences subsequent turns or exits, then maybe it's live.

However, from the list after Step 18, there doesn't seem to be any further mention of US 30. The driver goes onto PA 283 and eventually takes PA 183 South towards Reading Airport. So unless the fact of being on US 30 affects something else, like tolls or specific road features, it's not clear.

But in this context, I think that after Step 18, the variable representing being on US 30 isn't used again, so its effect is not live anymore. Therefore, the answer would be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 2, the driver getting on US 5, live at any point after Step 9?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 2 is live at any point after Step 9 in this travel route. Let me break it down.

First, what's Step 2? It says the driver gets on US 5. So that's when they start driving on US 5/Main Street. Now, I need to see if this action affects anything beyond Step 9.

Looking at the steps after Step 9: Step 10 mentions turning left onto Main Street/CT 110. Then there are several turns and changes in streets like East Main Street, Barnum Avenue, Ferry Boulevard, etc. The route continues through various roads like US 1, CT 130 West, Elm Street, Birdseye Street, Woodend Road, Sperry Avenue, Dodge Avenue, Access Road, Lordship Boulevard/CT 113, and Great Meadow Road.

Now, I need to see if the driver's action in Step 2 (getting on US 5) has any effect after Step 9. The key here is whether the variable (US 5 being active) is used again later.

In the steps beyond Step 9, there are mentions of various streets and avenues but not specifically about US 5 again. However, Step 7 says to keep right to stay on US 5, which is after the initial turn onto US 5 in Step 2. So, at Step 7, they're still on US 5.

Then, in Step 8, taking exit 36 onto CT 110 toward Stratford/Shelton. So, they leave US 5 here and go onto CT 110. After that, the route continues through other streets but doesn't mention returning to US 5 again.

Wait, but the question is about whether the effect from Step 2 (getting on US 5) is live after Step 9. So, even if they're still on US 5 at Step 7, does that count as being used again? Or does it need to be explicitly mentioned again?

I think in data-flow analysis, a variable is live if its value is used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, the driver being on US 5 at Step 2 and possibly still on it at Step 7 means the effect (US 5 being active) is still present. Therefore, after Step 9, there's no explicit use of US 5 again beyond Step 7, but the variable remains until they exit onto CT 110.

Wait, but after exiting, is there any mention of US 5 again? The steps don't show returning to US 5. So, once they leave US 5 at Step 8, they're not using it anymore. Therefore, the effect from Step 2 (being on US 5) would no longer be active after that point.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine the steps:

Step 2: Turn right onto US 5/Main Street.
...
Step 7: Keep right to stay on US 5.
Step 8: Take exit 36 onto CT 110 toward Stratford/Shelton.

So, in Step 7, they're still on US 5. So the effect from Step 2 is active until they leave at Step 8. After that, they are no longer on US 5.

The question is whether this effect (being on US 5) is live after Step 9. Since Step 9 is after Step 8, which is when they left US 5, the effect from Step 2 would have been overwritten or discarded by then. Therefore, it's not live anymore after Step 9.

Wait, but in data-flow analysis, if a variable is used again later, even implicitly, it's considered live. Here, the driver was on US 5 until Step 8, and beyond that, they are not on US 5 anymore. So after Step 9, which is after they've left US 5, the effect isn't active.

I think I might have overcomplicated this. The main point is whether the action from Step 2 affects anything after Step 9. Since the driver leaves US 5 at Step 8 and doesn't return, there's no live effect afterward.

  Is the effect from Step 25, the driver getting on TX 114, live at any point after Step 25?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 25 in this travel route is ""live"" after that step. Let me break it down.

Step 25 says the driver gets on TX 114 and continues on it. The question is whether the action at Step 25 affects any steps after that. So, I need to check all the steps after Step 25 to see if they depend on the action taken there.

Looking at the route steps, after Step 25, which is 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.' and then 'Turn right onto 10th Street.', but wait, no, actually, after getting on TX 114, the next step is 'Continue on TX 114.' Then it continues with 'Keep left to stay on TX 114.' So the driver is still on TX 114 for a while.

Then at Step 31: 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.', but wait, no, that's before. Wait, let me recount:

After getting on TX 114 (Step 25), the next steps are:
- Continue on TX 114.
- Keep left to stay on TX 114.
- Turn left onto Brush Avenue.
Wait, no, after Step 25 is 'Continue on TX 114.', then 'Keep left to stay on TX 114.' Then 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.' Hmm, but that seems like the driver turns off TX 114 at some point.

Wait, actually, looking again:

Step 25: Turn left onto Brush Avenue.
No, wait, no. Let me clarify the exact steps after Step 24:

After getting on TX 114 (Step 25), the next step is 'Continue on TX 114.' Then 'Keep left to stay on TX 114.' Then 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.' Wait, that doesn't make sense because if you're continuing on TX 114 and then turning left onto Brush Avenue, that's a turn off. But maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, the exact steps are:

25: Turn left onto TX 114. Continue on TX 114.
26: Keep left to stay on TX 114.
27: Turn left onto Brush Avenue.
28: Turn right onto 10th Street.
29: Turn left after 850 meters or 80-98 seconds.
30: Turn right after 20 meters or 5-6 seconds.
31: Turn left after 37 meters or 10-12 seconds.
32: Turn left onto Thompson Street.
33: Turn right onto 9th Street.
34: Turn left onto Be Hawkins Drive.
35: Turn left after 268 meters or 27-33 seconds.
36: Continue for 148 meters or 21-26 seconds.
37: Your destination is on the right.

Wait, actually, Step 25 is 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.' No, no. Let me get the exact numbering:

Looking back, the route steps provided are from 0 to 37. So Step 24 is 'Take the TX 199 West ramp.', then Step 25: 'Bear left onto Jacksboro Highway.', Step 26: 'Take the TX 199 West ramp.', Step 27: 'Bear right toward FM 730/Boyd.', Step 28: 'Bear left onto Northwest Parkway.', Step 29: 'Bear right onto Boyd Road/FM 730. Continue on FM 730.', Step 30: 'Turn left onto West Rock Island Avenue/TX 114. Continue on TX 114.', Step 31: 'Keep left to stay on TX 114.', Step 32: 'Turn left onto Brush Avenue.', Step 33: 'Turn right onto 10th Street.', and so on.

So, at Step 30, the driver turns onto TX 114 and continues. Then Step 31 is keeping left on TX 114. Step 32 is turning left onto Brush Avenue, which is a turn off from TX 114. So after Step 32, they leave TX 114.

Therefore, the effect of getting on TX 114 at Step 30 (which is Step 25 in some count?) Wait, actually, in the original list, Step 24: 'Take the TX 199 West ramp.', then Step 25: 'Bear left onto Jacksboro Highway.', etc. So perhaps the user's Step 25 refers to getting on TX 114.

But regardless of exact numbering, after turning onto TX 114, they continue on it for a while before turning off at Brush Avenue. So any steps after that depend on having turned onto TX 114, but since TX 114 is no longer being used after that point, the effect is not live because it's only used until Step 32.

Wait, but in terms of variables, if the route instructions up to a certain point use the fact that they are on TX 114, does that variable (being on TX 114) get used again later? No, because after Step 30/25, they continue on TX 114 for a few steps and then turn off. So the effect of being on TX 114 is only used until Step 32 or so, then it's no longer relevant.

But in terms of live variables, a variable is live if its value is used again after that point. So, after Step 25 (assuming that's when they get on TX 114), are there any steps later where the fact that they were on TX 114 is needed? I don't think so because they leave TX 114 at Step 32 or so.

Therefore, the effect of being on TX 114 at Step 25 isn't used again after that. So it's not a live variable.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 15, the driver getting on First Coast Highway, live at any point after Step 19?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 15 is still ""live"" at any point after Step 19 in this travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, what's a live variable? From the benchmark given, a live variable is one whose value will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So I need to see if the action from Step 15 affects anything beyond that point, specifically until Step 19.

Looking at the route steps:

Step 15: ""Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto First Coast Highway/FL A1A.""

Step 16: ""Enter the roundabout and take the 2nd exit onto First Coast Highway/FL A1A."" – Wait, that's the same as Step 15 again. So maybe there's a typo or duplication here? Let me check.

Yes, Steps 15 through 18 all say the same thing: entering the roundabout and taking the 2nd exit onto First Coast Highway/FL A1A. That seems repetitive. Maybe it's a mistake in the list, but I'll proceed with that information.

Step 19 is ""Turn left to stay on FL A1A."" So after Step 15, they are entering and exiting multiple roundabouts, then turning left to remain on FL A1A.

Now, does the action from Step 15 (entering First Coast Highway) have any effect beyond that point? Well, in terms of data flow analysis, if a variable is set here, when is it used again?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The term ""live"" here refers to whether the state or value from Step 15 affects anything after Step 19. So perhaps the route after Step 19 might involve using the highway they entered in Step 15.

Looking ahead, after Step 19, the route continues on FL A1A and eventually takes the ferry, drives southeast, and so on. It seems like once you're on FL A1A, you stay on it for a while, then take other roads. So maybe the initial entrance onto First Coast Highway in Step 15 is no longer relevant after that point.

But wait, Step 19 is turning left to stay on FL A1A. So after that, they continue on FL A1A until taking the ferry. The First Coast Highway is part of FL A1A, so once you're on it, maybe the action in Step 15 doesn't directly affect anything beyond, unless there's a specific usage later.

However, I'm not sure if ""live"" refers to the highway being used again or if it's about whether the decision made at Step 15 is still relevant. Since after Step 19 they're continuing on FL A1A, and then taking other roads, maybe the initial entrance doesn't have any future effect beyond that point.

Alternatively, perhaps in the context of data flow analysis, if a variable (like being on First Coast Highway) is used again later, it's live. But in this case, once you're on FL A1A, you don't specifically use First Coast Highway again unless there's another exit or something. It seems like after Step 19, they're just driving along FL A1A and then taking other roads.

I'm a bit confused because Steps 15-18 are redundant. Maybe the user intended to have multiple exits but there was an error. So perhaps in reality, it's only one entrance into First Coast Highway, which is then followed by continuing on it and eventually leaving via other routes.

In that case, after Step 19, they're already on FL A1A, so the initial action of entering might not have any future impact beyond being on the highway. Therefore, maybe the effect from Step 15 isn't live after Step 19 because they've already moved past that point and are continuing on the same road.

But wait, in data flow terms, if a variable is set at Step 15, when it's used again later, it's considered live. Here, the action in Step 15 sets them onto First Coast Highway, but after that, they continue on FL A1A without taking another exit. So maybe the effect isn't ""used"" again beyond that initial entrance.

Alternatively, if the route had a future usage of First Coast Highway after Step 19, then it would be live. But in this case, they're just continuing along it and then moving off via other roads. So perhaps the effect is no longer relevant or used again later.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the answer would be No because the action at Step 15 doesn't influence anything after Step 19.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on I 195, live at any point after Step 3?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of getting on I 195 in Step 3 is live at any point after that step. Let me break it down.

First, what does ""live"" mean here? It means if a variable's value will be used again before being discarded. In this scenario, we're looking at travel directions, so the variables are probably the highway segments or exits taken during the route planning.

Looking at the steps provided, Step 3 is taking the I 195 West ramp towards Baltimore-Washington Parkway/Parking/Return to Terminal. The question is whether any future step uses I 195 again after this point.

I'll go through each step one by one after Step 3 to see if there's another mention of I 195 or related exits.

Step 4: Continue on I 195 West/Metropolitan Boulevard. So, yes, it continues on I 195 here, which is a reuse of the same highway segment.

Even though in Step 5, they take exit 4A onto I 95 North, that's a different highway, so that doesn't count as I 195 being used again.

Moving forward, after Step 4, I don't see any other steps mentioning I 195. So the only reuse is in Step 4 right after Step 3.

Therefore, since the driver gets on I 195 at Step 3 and continues on it in Step 4, the effect (being on I 195) is indeed used again later, making it live.

  Is the effect from Step 5, the driver getting on I 80, live at any point after Step 7?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 5 is live at any point after Step 7 in this travel route. Let me break it down.

First, what's a ""live variable"" according to the benchmark? It's a variable that will be used again before being overwritten or discarded. So, I'm looking for if something set in Step 5 is used again after Step 7.

Looking at the steps:

Step 5: Take the I 80 ramp on the right.
So, this is where the driver gets onto I 80. Maybe ""I 80"" is a variable here.

Now, let's see the route after Step 7. Wait, what's Step 7? Let me count:

1. Drive west.
2. Turn left...
3. Turn right...
4. Turn left...
5. Take the I 80 ramp on the right. (Step 5)
6. Keep left to stay on I 80. (Step 6)
7. Keep left to stay on I 80. (Step 7)

So, after Step 7, what happens? Let's go beyond Step 7:

8. Take exit 277 on the right onto PA 940/PATP/I 476 toward Allentown/Wilkes-Barre.
9. Keep left at the fork.
10. Keep right to take I 476 South...
11. Keep left to take I 476/PATP South/Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension.
12. Take exit 16 on the right onto I 76 East...
13. Keep left to take exit 16A onto I 76 East...
14. Take exit 340B on the right onto US 1 North...
15. Keep left to take US 1 North...
16. Take the exit on the right toward Germantown Avenue.
17. Keep left to take Roberts Avenue...
18. Turn left onto Germantown Avenue.
19. Turn right after 3289 meters...
20. Continue for 144 meters...
21. Destination is on the left.

So, after Step 7 (keeping left to stay on I 80), the next steps involve exiting I 80 at exit 277 and then taking other roads like PA 940, I 476, etc. So, does ""I 80"" get used again? Well, in the given steps, after Step 7, we leave I 80 via exit 277. So, I don't think I 80 is used again beyond that point.

Wait, but maybe when they take exit 16 onto I 76 East later (Step 12), is there any connection to I 80? I don't see any further references to I 80 after Step 7. So the effect of getting on I 80 in Step 5 isn't used again after Step 7.

Therefore, the answer should be No.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 2, the driver getting on Perryman Road, live at any point after Step 8?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 2 is live after Step 8 in this travel route planning scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, what's a ""live variable"" in this context? From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. In terms of the route steps, I think this means whether the action taken at Step 2 (getting onto Perryman Road) has any impact on the actions after Step 8.

Looking at the route steps, Step 2 is ""Turn right onto Perryman Road/MD 159."" After that, they continue to stay on Perryman Road through multiple steps. So, by being on Perryman Road, the driver is making several left and right turns along the same road before moving on to other roads.

Now, after Step 8, which is ""Keep right to take exit 62 onto I 95 South,"" the driver leaves Perryman Road. The question is whether the initial action of getting on Perryman Road (Step 2) has any effect after that point. Since the driver continues on Perryman Road for several steps before exiting, that means the choice made at Step 2 does influence the path taken until Step 8.

But wait, once they take exit 62 onto I 95 South, they're leaving Perryman Road behind. So, does the fact that they were on Perryman Road from Steps 2 to 7 still matter after Step 8? Or is it only relevant while they are on Perryman Road?

I think the key here is whether the variable (being on Perryman Road) has any effect beyond its use. Once they exit Perryman Road at Step 8, there's no further use of that information. So the value from Step 2 might not be used again after Step 8.

Wait, but in programming terms, variables are live if their values influence subsequent operations. In this case, the route steps are a series of directions. The action at Step 2 (turning onto Perryman Road) is a variable that affects the next few steps because they continue on that road. However, after leaving Perryman Road at Step 8, there's no further use of that information.

So perhaps after Step 8, the effect from Step 2 isn't used anymore. Therefore, it wouldn't be considered live after Step 8.

Alternatively, if the driver continues to use the same road, maybe the initial turn is still relevant as part of the overall route, but once they leave, it's no longer affecting future steps. So the variable might not be live after that point.

I'm a bit confused because while being on Perryman Road affects the intermediate steps until Step 8, after that, it doesn't directly influence any further actions. Therefore, the effect from Step 2 isn't used again after Step 8, making it non-live.

  Is the effect from Step 10, the driver getting on I 93, live at any point after Step 14?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the action in Step 10 affects anything after Step 14. Let me break this down.

First, let's list out the steps again to get a clear picture:

1. Drive north.
2. Turn left after 44 meters or 7-9 seconds.
3. Turn right onto Webster Street.
4. Make a sharp left onto Kenoza Avenue/MA 110.
5. Turn left onto Main Street/MA 110/MA 125.
6. Turn left onto MA 114 East/MA 125 South/Turnpike Street.
7. Keep right to take Andover Bypass/MA 125 South.
8. Take the exit on the right after 41 meters or 2-3 seconds.
9. Bear right onto Andover Bypass/MA 125. Continue on MA 125.
10. Take the I 93 South ramp on the right toward Boston.
11. Keep left to take I 93 South/Interstate 93 HOV lane.
12. Keep left to stay on I 93 South/Interstate 93 HOV lane.
13. Keep right to take I 93 South/US 1 toward I 95/Providence Rhode Island.
14. Take exit 2A on the right onto MA 138 South toward Stoughton.
15. Keep left to stay on MA 138.
16. Turn left onto Washington Street/MA 138.
17. Keep right to stay on Washington Street.
18. Enter Taunton Green and take the 2nd exit onto US 44/MA 140/Taunton Green.
19. Bear right onto Summer Street/MA 140. Continue on MA 140.
20. Take exit 4 on the right toward Mount Pleasant Street/Airport Road.
21. Turn left onto Mount Pleasant Street.
22. Turn right onto Downey Street.
23. Turn right after 1330 meters or 95-116 seconds.
24. Continue for 59 meters or 12-15 seconds.
25. Arrived at destination.

Now, the question is about whether the effect from Step 10 (getting on I 93) is live at any point after Step 14.

Step 10 is where the driver takes the I 93 South ramp toward Boston. So, that action would involve entering Interstate 93 heading south.

Looking at Steps 11-13: they continue on I 93 South, moving towards US 1 and then I 95 towards Providence. So after Step 10, the driver remains on I 93 for several steps until exiting onto MA 138 at Step 14.

Wait, no, actually, Step 14 is taking exit 2A onto MA 138. So, that's when they leave I 93 and switch to MA 138.

So, from Step 10 onwards, the driver is on I 93 South until they take exit 2A at Step 14. Therefore, Step 10's action (entering I 93) directly leads up to Step 14, where they are no longer on I 93.

Now, the question is if there's any live effect after Step 14. A live variable or effect in data flow analysis refers to whether a value is used again later. So, does anything from Step 10 affect anything that happens after Step 14?

After leaving I 93 at Step 14, they take MA 138 South and continue on various streets leading towards Taunton Green, Summer Street, Mount Pleasant Street, Downey Street, etc., until arriving at the destination.

I don't see any reference to I 93 again. So, after exiting I 93 at Step 14, there's no further use of I 93 or anything related to it in the subsequent steps. Therefore, the effect from Step 10 (entering I 93) doesn't influence anything after Step 14.

Wait, but perhaps the direction on I 93 might have an impact elsewhere? Or maybe the fact that they took that ramp is recorded somehow. But in terms of the route instructions given, there's no indication that any previous steps affect later actions beyond the immediate turns and streets taken.

So, considering data flow analysis, if a variable (here, action) is used again after its definition, it's live. In this case, Step 10 defines an action on I 93, but after Step 14, there are no further references to I 93 or anything that depends on that action. Therefore, the effect from Step 10 isn't live after Step 14.

  Is the effect from Step 3, the driver getting on Burlington Woods Drive, live at any point after Step 5?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect of being on Burlington Woods Drive from Step 3 is still live after Step 5. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps for clarity:

Step 1: Drive north.
Step 2: Turn right after 24 meters or 8-10 seconds.
Step 3: Turn right onto Burlington Woods Drive.
Step 4: Make a sharp left to stay on Burlington Woods Drive.
Step 5: Turn right onto Burlington Mall Road.

The question is about whether the effect of being on Burlington Woods Drive (from Step 3) remains live after Step 5. 

I think I need to analyze each step and see if there's any point after Step 5 where Burlington Woods Drive is used again or its value is needed again. So, let me go through each step one by one.

Step 1: Driving north. No mention of specific roads, so probably just the general direction.
Step 2: Turning right after a certain distance or time. Again, not specifying a road name, but it's part of the process to get onto Burlington Woods Drive in Step 3.
Step 3: Turning right onto Burlington Woods Drive. So now they're on this road.
Step 4: Making a sharp left to stay on Burlington Woods Drive. This confirms that after turning right in Step 3, they are still on Burlington Woods Drive because of the left turn.
Step 5: Turning right onto Burlington Mall Road. Now, they leave Burlington Woods Drive and turn onto another road.

So, from Step 3 to Step 4, the driver is definitely on Burlington Woods Drive. Then, in Step 5, they turn off onto a different road. After that, I need to check if there's any future step where Burlington Woods Drive is used again or its information is needed again.

Looking ahead beyond Step 5:

Step 6: Turn right onto Cambridge Street/MA 3A.
Step 7: Take the I 95 North ramp.
Step 8: Take exit 55B onto I 93 North.
Step 9: Take exit 35 onto MA 125.
Step 10: Keep right on MA 125 North.
Step 11: Turn left onto Gould Road.
Step 12: Bear right onto South Main Street/MA 28.
Step 13: Turn left onto Hidden Road.
Step 14: Continue for a certain distance.
Step 15: Destination is on the right.

None of these steps mention Burlington Woods Drive again. So, after Step 5, the driver leaves that road and doesn't return to it or use its value again. Therefore, the effect from Step 3 isn't used again after Step 5, making it non-live.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 15, the driver getting on US 17, live at any point after Step 20?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 15 is live at any point after Step 20 in the given travel route scenario. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand what each step entails. The goal is to go from Hilton Head Airport to St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC. The steps are a series of turns and road changes that the driver takes.

Step 15: The driver gets on US 17 North towards Charleston/Beaufort after taking exit 33. So at this point, the driver is entering US 17 and moving north towards those cities.

Now, I need to check if this action (getting onto US 17) has an effect that's live beyond Step 20. A live variable or effect is something that will be used again in the future before being discarded or overwritten. In data-flow analysis terms, it means that the value or state created at Step 15 might influence later steps.

Looking ahead to Step 20: At this point, the driver takes an exit on the right after a certain distance and time. The exact wording is ""Take the exit on the right after 7550 meters or 400-488 seconds."" So, from Step 15 onwards, the driver is moving along US 17 North.

Now, after taking that exit (Step 20), the next steps involve driving on Lockwood Drive, Meeting Street, and then reaching the destination. Since the goal is to reach St. Michael's Episcopal Church, I assume that this action of getting onto US 17 at Step 15 is necessary for the overall route. The driver needs to be on US 17 North to eventually take the exit leading towards Charleston.

Therefore, the effect from Step 15 (getting on US 17) directly influences what happens in Steps 20 and beyond because without being on US 17, the subsequent exits wouldn't lead to the destination. So, this effect is definitely used again later.

I don't think there's any step after Step 20 that would contradict or override this action. The route continues along roads that are branches from US 17, like Lockwood Drive and Meeting Street, but the main path via US 17 is still in play until the final exit.

So, yes, the effect from Step 15 is live at least through Step 20 and beyond because it's part of the ongoing journey towards the destination.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 12, the driver getting on 2nd Avenue, live at any point after Step 12?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the effect from Step 12 is live after that step. The route steps provided are a list of directions from Monroe County Hospital in Forsyth, GA, to Rankin House in Columbus, GA. 

Step 12 is where the driver turns left onto 2nd Avenue/GA 85 and continues for a certain distance or time before arriving at their destination on the left. The question is whether the value from Step 12 (getting on 2nd Avenue) is live after that step.

First, I need to understand what ""live variable"" means in this context. A live variable is one whose value is used again in the future, meaning it's not immediately discarded or overwritten. In data-flow analysis terms, if a variable (or effect) is used later, it's considered live.

Looking at the route steps after Step 12: There's no further mention of turning left onto 2nd Avenue or using that road beyond Step 12. The destination is reached after continuing on 2nd Avenue for a certain distance and time. So, once the driver turns onto 2nd Avenue, they continue straight until reaching Rankin House.

In this scenario, the action at Step 12 (turning left) and the subsequent actions involve moving forward on 2nd Avenue. The destination is on the left after that stretch. Therefore, the direction from Step 12 (onto 2nd Avenue) is used to determine the path taken immediately after. 

However, the effect being referred to in Step 12 is the driver turning onto 2nd Avenue. Since this action directly affects the following steps by determining which street they're on, it's likely that this variable or effect influences subsequent decisions. The roundabout exits later on might depend on the current direction, but I'm not sure if that's a direct reuse.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about whether the specific variable representing the turn onto 2nd Avenue is used again after Step 12. If in any step after Step 12, the driver uses 2nd Avenue or refers back to it, then it's live. 

Looking at the steps beyond 12: They involve continuing on 2nd Avenue until the destination. So the action from Step 12 (turning left) is immediately followed by a continuation on that same avenue. Therefore, the effect of turning onto 2nd Avenue is indeed used again as they continue straight on it.

So yes, the effect is live after Step 12 because it's used to determine the current street, which influences the next steps.

Okay, so I need to determine if the effect from Step 6 is still alive after Step 7 in the given travel route. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out the steps:

Step 6: Turn right to take the I 64 East ramp.
Step 7: Keep left to stay on I 64 East.

The question is whether the effect of getting on I 64 at Step 6 remains live after Step 7. 

Live variable analysis means a value is considered live if it's used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded. In this context, ""effect"" could refer to the action taken (getting onto I 64) and whether that action has any impact later on.

At Step 6, the driver turns right onto I 64 East. Then at Step 7, they keep left to stay on I 64 East. So, after Step 7, they're still on I 64 East. This suggests that the effect of being on I 64 East continues beyond Step 6.

Therefore, since Step 6's action leads directly into Step 7 where the driver remains on I 64 East, the effect is definitely alive at Step 7.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 20, the driver getting on I 5, live at any point after Step 25?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the effect from Step 20 is still ""live"" after Step 25 in the given travel route. First, let me make sure I understand what a ""live variable"" is. From the definition provided, a variable is live if its value will be used again in the future before being overwritten or discarded.

In this scenario, we're looking at a driving route with specific steps from Step 1 to Step 35. The question is about Step 20 and whether its effect is still active after Step 25. Let me break down what each step entails.

Step 20: Take exit 119 on the right toward Steilacoom/DuPont Road. So, at this point, the driver is taking an exit onto a specific road. This action involves turning right onto a particular road, so I can assume that the instruction to take exit 119 is used here.

Now, looking ahead to Step 25: Take exit 109 on the right toward Martin Way/College Street/Sleater-Kinney Road North. So, after Step 20, there are several steps in between, including taking exits at 122B-A, 122A, 120B-A, etc., all the way down to exit 109.

I need to check if the action taken at Step 20 (taking exit 119) is used again before being discarded. From the sequence, after Step 20, the driver continues on I-5 South and takes several exits: 130, 122B-A, 122A, 120B-A, 119, etc.

Wait a second, Step 25 is taking exit 109, which is before exit 119. So actually, after Step 20 (exit 119), the driver continues on I-5 and later takes exit 109 at Step 25. Therefore, the instruction to take exit 119 (Step 20) is used again when they reach it again after proceeding past other exits.

So, in this case, the effect of Step 20 is indeed used again at a later point, meaning it's live after Step 25.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 11, the driver getting on Main Street, live at any point after Step 13?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 11 is live after Step 13 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails and how they interact with each other. The goal is to get from Stamford Hospital in Stamford, CT, to Spencer House in Hartford, CT. The route provided has several steps that outline turns and directions along the way.

Step 11 says ""Turn left onto US 5/Main Street."" So at this point, the driver is getting onto Main Street via US 5. This means they're entering Main Street from another road, perhaps coming from a different direction or intersection.

Now, looking ahead to Step 13: ""Make a sharp left to stay on Main Street."" This step is about continuing along Main Street after possibly turning again. So the driver stays on Main Street here.

The question is whether the effect (the state of being on Main Street) from Step 11 is live at any point after Step 13. That means, does the action in Step 11 have a lasting impact that affects the driver's position or actions beyond Step 13?

In data-flow analysis terms, we're looking for liveness: whether a variable (here, the state of being on Main Street) remains relevant after a certain point. If the effect from Step 11 is used again later, it's live.

After Step 11, the driver is definitely on Main Street. Then in Step 13, they make another left to stay on Main Street. So the fact that they're on Main Street at Step 11 is still relevant because they are continuing on Main Street in subsequent steps. Therefore, the effect from Step 11 isn't discarded immediately; it's carried forward.

So yes, the effect from Step 11 is live after Step 13 because the driver remains on Main Street and that state continues to affect their route beyond that point.

  Is the effect from Step 13, the driver getting on CR 541, live at any point after Step 14?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 13 is live after Step 14 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down.

First, let's understand what each step entails.

Step 13: The driver turns right onto CR 541/Burlington-Mount Holly Road. So, they're getting on this road at this point.

Step 14: They take the CR 541 South exit on the right toward NJ 38/Lumberton/Medford. This means they're exiting CR 541 and turning onto another road, likely NJ 38.

Now, the question is whether the effect from Step 13 (getting on CR 541) is live after Step 14. That means we need to see if the fact that they were on CR 541 before Step 14 still has an impact or influence beyond that point.

So, when you're driving along CR 541 and then exit onto NJ 38, does being on CR 541 have any further effect? Well, once you leave CR 541, I don't see how the previous action of getting onto CR 541 would affect anything else. The destination is reached after several more steps.

Looking at the route steps beyond Step 14: After exiting CR 541, they turn left onto NJ 38/State Route 38, then right onto Main Street/CR 691, make a sharp left to stay on CR 691, and then some turns leading to the destination. There's no indication that the previous action of being on CR 541 has any further effect after leaving it at Step 14.

In data-flow analysis terms, live variables are those whose values affect future steps. Once you leave CR 541, there's nothing else using that information about having been on CR 541. So, the value isn't used again later.

Therefore, the effect from Step 13 is not live after Step 14 because the action no longer influences any subsequent steps.

  Is the effect from Step 8, the driver getting on I 84, live at any point after Step 14?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 8, where the driver gets on I 84, is still relevant (or ""live"") at any point after Step 14 in the given travel route. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's list out all the steps to have a clear picture:

1. Drive northeast on Northwest Lovejoy Street.
2. Bear left onto Broadway Bridge.
3. Turn left onto Northeast 24th Avenue.
4. Turn right onto Northeast Broadway.
5. Turn right onto Northeast 37th Avenue.
6. Keep left to take Northeast Halsey Street.
7. Turn left onto Northeast 238th Drive.
8. Take exit 22 on the right toward Corbett.
9. Take exit 64 on the right onto OR 35 toward White Salmon/Government Camp.
10. Take exit 76 on the right toward Rowena.
11. Keep right to take I 84 East/Columbia River Highway toward Rowena.
12. Take exit 84 on the right onto US 30 east toward The Dalles City Center.
13. Bear right onto West 2nd Street/US 30. Continue on US 30.
14. Turn left after 657 meters or 29-35 seconds.
15. Turn left onto Union Street.
16. Turn left onto West 2nd Street/US 30.
17. Continue for 13 meters or 4-5 seconds.
18. Your destination is on the left.

Now, Step 8 is when the driver takes the I 84 East ramp toward Troutdale/Hood River. The question is whether this action (getting on I 84) has a live effect after Step 14. 

To determine if an effect is live, we need to see if its result is used again later in the code. In data flow analysis terms, if a variable (in this case, the action of getting on I 84) is used again later, it's considered live.

Looking at the steps after Step 14:

- Step 13: Bear right onto West 2nd Street/US 30 and continue.
- Step 14: Turn left after some time or distance.
- Step 15: Turn left onto Union Street.
- Step 16: Turn left onto West 2nd Street/US 30.
- Step 17: Continue for a short distance.

Now, looking at the directions, after getting on I 84 in Step 8 and continuing through some exits (Steps 9 to 11), they eventually exit I 84 again at Step 12 to take US 30. Then, later steps involve turning onto West 2nd Street/US 30, which is mentioned multiple times (Steps 13, 16-17). 

But does this mean that the initial action of getting on I 84 in Step 8 has a live effect? The initial entrance to I 84 might be used again when they exit it later at Step 12. However, in terms of data flow analysis, we're looking for the variable (the state of being on I 84) and whether that value is used again after Step 14.

After Step 14, the driver is still on US 30, which was taken at Step 12 after exiting I 84. So, the effect from entering I 84 is used when they exit it at Step 12, but does this influence any steps after Step 14? The steps after 14 involve more turns on US 30 and Union Street, etc., but not directly using the fact that they were on I 84.

Alternatively, perhaps the variable representing being on I 84 isn't used again after Step 12. So, after Step 14, the driver is already off I 84, so the effect from Step 8 might no longer be live.

Wait, but let's think again. The initial action in Step 8 starts the process of being on I 84, which then leads through several steps until they exit at Step 12. After that, they continue on US 30, making turns and such. So, after exiting I 84, the effect from being on I 84 is no longer active because they've already left it. Therefore, any use of the variable (being on I 84) would have been before Step 14.

So, after Step 14, the driver has already exited I 84 and is moving along US 30. Thus, the effect from Step 8 isn't used again later because the driver is no longer on I 84 after Step 12. Therefore, the answer should be ""No"" because the effect from Step 8 isn't live after Step 14.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 13, the driver getting on US 422, live at any point after Step 17?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect of Step 13 is live at any point after Step 17 in this travel route scenario. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. Step 13 says the driver gets on US 422. Now, the question is asking if this action affects anything after Step 17. To determine if it's ""live,"" we have to see if the variable (in this case, getting on US 422) is used again later.

Looking at the steps provided, after Step 13, which is ""Keep left to take US 422/Pottstown Expressway,"" I need to check all subsequent steps to see if there's any use of US 422 or related variables. 

Let me list out the steps from 14 onwards:

14. Take the exit on the right toward Sanatoga.
15. Turn right toward Ridge Pike.
16. Turn left onto Limerick Center Road.
17. Turn right after 1243 meters or 86-106 seconds.
18. Continue for 84 meters or 16-19 seconds.
19. Your destination is on the left.

I'm looking for any mention of US 422 in these steps beyond Step 13. After Step 13, the next mentions of US 422 are:

- In Step 14: The driver takes exit 328A onto US 202 South/US 422 West toward Pottstown.
- So, after taking that exit, the driver is on US 422 again.

Wait, but in Step 14, it's the same as Step 13? Or is it a separate mention. Let me check:

Step 13: Keep left to take US 422/Pottstown Expressway.
Then, at Step 14: Take the exit onto US 202 South/US 422 West toward Pottstown.

So, yes, after Step 13, in Step 14, they are still on US 422. That means the initial action of getting on US 422 in Step 13 affects what happens later because they continue on it in subsequent steps.

Therefore, since the effect (being on US 422) is used again later (in Steps 14, 15, etc.), the variable is live after Step 17.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 6, the driver getting on 200, live at any point after Step 6?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",Yes,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the effect from Step 6 is live after that step. Let me break it down.

Step 6 says the driver turns right onto 200 South. After that, there's a continue for 462 meters or about 42-52 seconds. Then, they've arrived at their destination. So, after turning onto 200 South, the driver continues on that road for a bit before arriving.

Now, I need to check if any of these steps use the value from Step 6 again later. The main variable here is probably the direction or the street name ""200 South."" 

Looking at the steps after Step 6: they just continue on 200 South and then arrive. There's no indication that this information (like the street number or direction) is used again in any decision-making or further actions. So, once the driver turns onto 200 South, they don't use that fact again except for continuing on it.

Since the variable isn't referenced again after Step 6, it doesn't seem to be used later. Therefore, the effect from Step 6 isn't live after that step.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 7, the driver getting on Haywood Road, live at any point after Step 12?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 7 is live at any point after Step 12 in this travel route scenario. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. The goal is to go from ST FRANCIS-EASTSIDE (GREENVILLE, SC) to Anderson Regional Airport (ANDERSON, SC). The route has a series of turns and directions that the driver follows.

Step 7 is ""Turn left onto Haywood Road."" So, at this point, the driver is turning left onto Haywood Road. Now, I need to see if this action affects any subsequent steps after Step 12.

Looking at the steps beyond Step 7:

- Step 8: Bear left to stay on Haywood Road.
- Step 9: Turn right after 61 meters or 5-6 seconds.
- Step 10: Turn left after 57 meters or 11-14 seconds.
- Step 11: Turn right onto Laurel Creek Lane.
- Step 12: Turn left onto Carolina Avenue.

Wait, but the question is about whether the effect from Step 7 (getting on Haywood Road) is live at any point after Step 12. So I need to check if there's any use of the variable (Haywood Road) after Step 12 or its effects.

Looking further beyond Step 12:

- Step 13: Turn right onto Amber Drive.
- Step 14: Turn left onto Wembley Road.
- Step 15: Turn right onto Shelburne Road.
- ... and so on until the destination is reached.

I don't see any references to Haywood Road after Step 8. After turning left in Step 7, they bear left again in Step 8, then proceed with various turns and eventually leave Haywood Road.

However, sometimes in data flow analysis, a variable might influence future steps indirectly through subsequent actions. But here, the direct use of Haywood Road is only until Step 8, where they turn onto other roads.

But wait, let me double-check. The driver turns left onto Haywood Road (Step 7), then bear left to stay on it (Step 8). Then in Step 9, they turn right after 61 meters, which exits them off Haywood Road. So, from Step 7 and 8, the driver is on Haywood Road, but once they turn right at Step 9, they're no longer on it.

So, does the effect of being on Haywood Road (Step 7) have any impact after Step 12? After Step 12, the driver is turning left onto Carolina Avenue. There's no mention of returning to Haywood Road later in the route. Therefore, the effect from Step 7 doesn't influence any steps beyond that.

However, sometimes variables can influence other parts through conditions or further actions. But here, the directions are straightforward without conditionals. The only use is in Steps 7 and 8, after which they leave Haywood Road.

Therefore, I think the answer should be No because the effect from Step 7 doesn't continue beyond Step 12.

Question:
  Is the effect from Step 24, the driver getting on PA 152, live at any point after Step 28?

Please answer with only “Yes” or “No” without any further explanation. Adhere to this rule strictly.",No,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the effect from Step 24 is live at any point after Step 28 in the given travel route. Let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what each step entails. Step 24 says ""Turn left onto Susquehanna Road/PA 152."" This means the driver has just entered PA 152, which is a key road in their journey towards Philadelphia.

Now, looking at Step 28: ""Bear right after 277 meters or 17-21 seconds."" After being on PA 152, they turn right onto Limekiln Pike/PA 152. So, they're still on PA 152 but have taken an exit, possibly heading further into the city.

The question is about whether the effect (being on PA 152) from Step 24 is live after Step 28. That means I need to check if PA 152's influence continues beyond that point.

From Step 24 onwards, the driver is on PA 152 until at least Step 28. The next step mentions ""Bear right onto Limekiln Pike/PA 152."" So, they're still on PA 152 even after that maneuver. This suggests that being on PA 152 continues to have an effect as they proceed.

Therefore, the effect from Step 24 is indeed live at least up until Step 28 and beyond because the driver remains on PA 152.
